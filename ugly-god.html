If you’ve been to the Dominican Republic, you should know they have a lot of Spanish, dark Dominicans. They are Black as fuck just like me. My dad happened to be a Black Dominican and my mom’s Black. African-Americans and Latinos have it rough in the U.S.—I’m both, so I guess I’m double rough”.</p><p>Rodriguez grew up speaking both Spanish and English.
