Immediately. Life is pointless without music for me.</li><li>People think that atheists have nothing to live for, but that’s not true – it’s that we have nothing to die for.</li><li>The idea of being part of this tapestry of humanity is a far more enlightening idea for me than believing you are going to this different place when you die. The magic of reality is far more potent.</li><li>I think I couldn’t give myself any advice apart from just do exactly what I want.</li><li>Music drives me insane, the incessant presence of music in my life. It informs how I see the world; it drives me crazy</li><li>One of my favorite quotes ever was from Slash from Guns and Roses and he said ‘to be truly iconic, you need to be able to recognized in a silhouette’</li><li>I think one of the dangers of humor is becoming seduced by it and sacrificing the story for a few laughs.</li></ul><h1 class="title style-scope ytd-video-primary-info-renderer">Matty Healy: ‘Art, sex, drugs, religion.
