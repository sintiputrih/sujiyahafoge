However, Cordae has stated numerous times that he still considers Jay and Nahmir to be his real-life brothers. The rapper has recently made headlines for his music and his relationship with No. 1 ranked tennis star, girlfriend, Naomi Osaka.</strong></p><h2><span id=Cordae-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings>Cordae- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings</span></h2><p>YBN Cordae (real name: Cordae Dunston) was born in 1997 in Raleigh, North Carolina. Every year on August 26th, the Atlantic Records artist celebrates his birthday. He was the eldest child in his family, with four siblings born after him. Cordae, who is of African-American descent, was raised by his single mother alongside his siblings.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Cordae_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Cordae?

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Osaka was forced to quarantine alone ahead of the 2020 U.S. Open. Cordae flew out to be there for her, which his girlfriend, Osaka, described as “the most romantic thing.”</p><p>The couple frequently shares their love with their fans on social media.

Later that month, in January 2015, he sent out another tweet, this time to his younger brother. Cordae stated that his 11-year-old brother became a gay man because he still believed in Santa Claus and was afraid of the dark.</p><p>Many people chastised him, claiming that being gay does not imply being stupid.
