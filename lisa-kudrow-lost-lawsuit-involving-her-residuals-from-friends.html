The main six were making $1 million per episode. However, making such a salary created some dilemmas behind the scenes. That was the case with <a href=#>Matt LeBlanc who was sued by his former manager</a>. As it turns out, the same situation took place with <strong><a href=#>Lisa Kudrow</a></strong>.</p><p>In the following, we're going to take a closer look at why Kudrow was sued by her former manager, and how she lost the court battle. In addition, we'll take a look at other related lawsuits to Friends, one of which took place with <strong><a href=#>Matt LeBlanc</a></strong> and his former manager.

This case ultimately will be resolved at the appellate level. Ms. Kudrow has faith in the judicial system, and she believes that the eventual outcome of this contractual dispute will be in her favor."</p><p>Ultimately, Kudrow's team was on the wrong end, and she was forced to fork over $1.6 million from the lawsuit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=it-wasn-39-t-the-only-time-friends-faced-a-lawsuit>It Wasn't The Only Time Friends Faced A Lawsuit</h2><p>Friends had other problems arise behind the scenes. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this specific case was dismissed by the California Supreme Court</a>. The court case was dealing with a sexual harassment lawsuit that apparently took place behind the scenes.</p><p>The LA Times writes, "The California Supreme Court threw out a sexual harassment lawsuit against the makers of the hit comedy “Friends” on Thursday, ruling that vulgar and coarse comments by the show’s writers reflected the “creative workplace” for a comedy with sexual themes."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/friends-cast-at-the-friends-reunion.jpg><p>"In ruling unanimously for Warner Bros. Television Productions, the state high court said the show’s writers did not direct their lewd comments at the woman who sued them or at women particularly. State law “does not outlaw sexually coarse and vulgar language or conduct that merely offends,” Justice Marvin R.

Camille Cerio is suing the actor for breach of contract and claims he owes her commission for managing his career."</p><p>"LeBlanc maintains he has paid Cerio more than $200,000 (GBP100,000) in payments, but in a lawsuit filed at Los Angeles Superior Court earlier this month (2Jul08), Cerio claims the amount is nothing compared to his royalties from Friends and spin-off Joey. Cerio claims that LeBlanc agreed to cut her 15 percent from all the pilots, but stopped paying her in 2000."</p><p>Unlike Lisa Kudrow was forced to pay her former manager, it doesn't seem like LeBlanc was found guilty of the claims. There wasn't any type of resolution posted online to the court case - which means the case was either dropped completely, or that a settlement was reached outside of court.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is clear, former managers wanted a chunk of the success from Friends, especially given the massive contracts negotiated by the cast.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijoquRYri2sNGormakn6jBbrjAsKquoaRitq%2FCzqWtoqaXYrWmvoyrnKyhlKqurb%2BMn6mopV2bv6qxzZ2qaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./prabhu-deva.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Prabhu Deva - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Married, Facts">&larr;
