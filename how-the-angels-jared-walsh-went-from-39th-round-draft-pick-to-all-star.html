But I honestly don’t think I could have gotten a bigger blessing if I tried. It worked out perfectly. I got to play at a place that I really enjoy, with great teammates. I got an opportunity. A lot of people in the 39th round don’t even get a chance. It’s like they kind of get released before they even get going.</p><p>“For me, it was a tough day, but looking back it’s one of the best things that ever happened to me.”</p><p>It certainly didn’t feel that way at the time.</p><p>Playing at the University of Georgia, Walsh had hit .188 as a junior, so he was bypassed in the draft and remained in school for his senior year. Few top pro prospects are left in college for their senior season, and the ones who are still there don’t have the leverage of returning to school, so when they are drafted they sign for relatively small bonuses.</p><p>Occasionally teams take college seniors in the seventh to 10th rounds, as a way to manipulate the spending of their bonus pools, which is mostly calculated based on the money paid in the top 10 rounds. If teams pay far under the slot value for a college senior in the 10th round, it gives them much more to spend to entice a high-round pick who has leverage.</p><p>After hitting .306 and posting a 2.60 ERA for Georgia, Walsh was told by a few scouts he would be one of those picks.</p><p>But he wasn’t. Not in the 10th round. Not in the 20th. Not in the 30th.</p><p>“That was a day I’ll never forget,” he said. “It was extremely discouraging. It was tough.”</p><p>It was still tough after the Angels picked Walsh and sent him to the rookie-level Arizona League. Typically, the players picked higher get the first opportunities. Walsh said he didn’t even play in the first few games.</p><p>Eventually, though, he began to shake the stigma of being a 39th-rounder.</p><p>“I showed a little bit through the summer,” he said. “And I did get a good opportunity when I went to low-A (Burlington, Iowa).”</p><p>As Walsh made the step-by-step climb through the Angels’ farm system, his numbers were decent, but not spectacular. He finally had a breakout in 2019 at Triple-A, when he hit .325 with 36 home runs and a 1.109 OPS at Salt Lake, earning a promotion to the big leagues.</p><p>Once in the majors, Walsh struggled, though. He continued struggling until August 2020, when he was sent back to Long Beach, where the Angels kept their top reserves with no Triple-A team during the pandemic.</p><p>Walsh returned to Anaheim with a slightly different swing and mindset. He said he focused more on getting “on top of the baseball” and hitting line drives, instead of getting under it.</p><p>He also had a different mental approach, which he says he learned from watching second baseman David Fletcher.</p><p>“He’s the most elite baseball mind that I’ve ever been around,” Walsh said. “He doesn’t take things personally. He treats it like a game. When you treat it like a game, you are going to get the most out of yourself.”</p><p>That has unquestionably happened.</p><p>Walsh hit .337 with nine homers and a 1.113 OPS in his last 22 games of 2020. After a slow start in 2021, he has been fairly consistent this season, with a .282 average, 22 homers and a .911 OPS after his two-homer game on Wednesday.</p><p>Those numbers earned him an invitation to the All-Star Game, which could be viewed as a victory for all overlooked players.</p><p>“I’m really pleased,” said Manager Joe Maddon, a former undrafted player. “He was a low draft choice, killed in the minor leagues, had to wait for his turn. Nobody wanted to give him a chance. Finally, he gets here. We give him an opportunity, and he’s taking full advantage of it.”</p><h4>UP NEXT</h4><p>Angels (RHP Alex Cobb, 6-3, 4.60 ERA) at Mariners (TBD), Friday, 7:10 p.m., Bally Sports West, 830&nbsp;AM</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2.wp.com/wpdash.medianewsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GettyImages-1326368577.jpg><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on ocregister.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnmKTEbsDHnmSappeaubR5yZqpnpxdrK6tv8dmrp6mpGKzs7vMZmpyrJhiv7DBzZ1knaqRm8FuvMicomasn2KurbiMrKuaql8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jack-nicholson-children-jack-nicholsons-children.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jack Nicholson Children: Meet Jack Nicholsons 6 Children">&larr;
