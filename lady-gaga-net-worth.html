She began her career as a musical theater and burlesque performer in the East Village of New York. After struggling for several years, she recorded her first album in 2005, which led to writing songs for other artists like Britney Spears and Fergie.</p><p>Although her first album, “The Fame”, was only moderately successful, her relentless touring paid off when the first single, “Just Dance”, became a hit. By the end of 2009, she had multiple Grammy nominations and two Grammy Awards.</p><p>Lady Gaga is known for her activism and exhibitionism, and her arrivals at awards shows receive their own special coverage.

Gaga signed a two-year Las Vegas residency in 2018 to perform at the MGM Park Theater. The residency consists of two types of shows: Enigma, which focuses on theatricality and includes the singer’s biggest hits, and Jazz and Piano, which involves tracks from the Great American Songbook and stripped-down versions of Gaga’s songs.
