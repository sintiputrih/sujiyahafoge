There are a variety of different reasons why fans don’t want to see certain wrestlers make a return.</p><h2 id=lio-rush><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Lio Rush</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lio-Rush-AEW.jpg><p>There is no denying the talents of Lio Rush, but he just wasn’t a good fit in AEW. Tony Khan couldn’t decide how to best book him, and he ended up in a mishmash of feuds before leaving after a very short run.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rush is someone who is a bit of a liability when it comes to going in and out of retirement, and AEW doesn’t really need that right now. He is best suited elsewhere, and AEW would be wise to avoid bringing him back in the future.</p><h2 id=mel><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Mel</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mel-in-the-AEW-ring-Cropped.jpg><p>Mel could well be one of, if not the most forgettable wrestler to have been on AEW’s roster. <a href=#>She was a bit-part player in the abysmal Nightmare Collective faction</a> and seemed to offer very little in terms of charisma or in-ring work.</p><p>This could have been a case of her being saddled with a terrible character and in a rubbish stable, but fans have little interest in ever seeing Mel, or the Nightmare Collective for that matter, ever again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ivelisse><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ivelisse</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ivelisse-Cropped.jpg><p>Ivelisse is someone who seemed to cause more trouble than she was worth. <a href=#>Stories of backstage heat with the likes of Thunder Rosa</a> led to AEW parting ways with her.</p><p>The AEW women’s roster has a lot of names and talent who deserve more spotlight and a bigger push, meaning that there is no space for Ivelisse even if she did come back and made amends with those who she had heat with.</p><h2 id=brandi-rhodes><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Brandi Rhodes</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/brandi-rhodes-promo-cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>No matter what storyline Brandi Rhodes was involved in, it simply was not good</a>. The Nightmare Collective was horrid, her role in the Women’s Tag Team Tournament was bland, and her final feud with Dan Lambert was on its way to being one of the worst in AEW history.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Top 10 Funniest Moments In AEW History</a></span></p><p>Fans don’t want to see her back in AEW due to all of that, although she did do a lot of work behind the scenes. In terms of an on-screen role, fans will be happy that she is now out of the company.</p><h2 id=jeff-hardy><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jeff Hardy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jeff-hardy-vs-bobby-fish-aew-dynamite.jpg><p>Jeff Hardy may still be under AEW contract, but it is probably for the best that he steers clear of ever returning to the ring. Wrestling has proven to be a means to Hardy causing trouble for himself, and he should instead focus on his well-being rather than a return.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Even in the few matches that he had in AEW</a>, he was clearly a beat slower than he had been in the past, and after years of huge bumps, wrestling in that same style cannot be good for his body.</p><h2 id=jack-evans><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jack Evans</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jack-Evans-wrestling-Cropped.jpg><p>In terms of in-ring work, Jack Evans is very talented. However, during his time at AEW, he failed to prove an overall charisma that would make him a strong TV character.</p><p>It was for the best that Evans left AEW, as fans had little interest when he was on-screen. Most fans won’t have an overwhelming desire to see him back, and he would likely be greeted with a dull reaction if he were to return. Evans is a flashy performer, but he just didn’t work out in AEW.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jimmy-havoc><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jimmy Havoc</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jimmy-Havoc-On-The-Ropes.jpg><p>Jimmy Havoc had an air of uniqueness about him when AEW started, but the controversy surrounding his name brought on by the Speaking Out movement is reason enough for fans to never want to see him again.</p><p>AEW is a better place without figures like that, and they would be best suited to never bring him back into the fold. He didn't do too much during his time in AEW, so wasn’t missed at all when he left.</p><h2 id=andrade-el-idolo><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Andrade El Idolo</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/andrade-el-idolo-cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Andrade El Idolo is currently suspended in AEW following a fight with Sammy Guevera</a>. Andrade initiated this to try and force a firing, but was instead suspended.</p><p>This sort of behavior is something that AEW does not need any more of, and it would be best to let his contract run out and leave him away from programming. In AEW, Andrade’s booking wasn’t great anyway, so he hasn’t been missed as such, even with his incredible talents.</p><h2 id=jake-atlas><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jake Atlas</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jake-Atlas-in-AEW-Cropped.jpg><p>After a promising start in AEW, Jake Atlas suffered a long-term injury. In his absence, allegations emerged, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PWInsider</a> reporting that he was “charged with misdemeanor battery”.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things AEW Stole From WCW</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This resulted in AEW cutting ties with him quietly, and it is for the best that he steers well clear from getting brought back. Much like with Jimmy Havoc, AEW has made the correct decision in quickly putting an end to the relationship between those who have been charged with and admitted things like that. Fans certainly don’t want to see him back.</p><h2 id=bobby-fish><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Bobby Fish</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/bobby-fish.jpg><p>Bobby Fish had quite a few strong matches when he first joined AEW, and the prospect of an Elite vs <a href=#>Undisputed Era</a> match was salivating.
