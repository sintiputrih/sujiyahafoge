Conservative Catholics seem to be rather—<i>ahem</i>—cross with him over his support of progressive economic policies, while more liberal Catholics feel betrayed because he hasn’t come right out and started ordaining married lesbians as priests, or at least he hasn’t yet.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-41642 alt="Benedict IX Francis" width=800 height=480 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/benedict-ix-francis-old1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-41642 class=wp-caption-text>Give him time. He’s only 78. Source: <a href=#>Jihad Watch</a></p><p>Honestly, for all the carping on both sides, it’s hard not to feel that the quality of papal controversy has fallen off somewhat from the golden age of the 11th century. As we have <a href=#>previously covered</a>, the Holy See was a bit wilder back then, and the Roman Primates tended to be a little more—well, primal. So it was for Benedict IX, who came to the throne in 1032 at the age of 12. Or maybe he was in his early 20s or at least he was when he was deposed by force—accounts differ. Sources do agree that he was probably in his 30s the second (or third) time he became pope. And it’s too bad he only made it to 35, since the money he made selling the office of Pope to the highest bidder would probably have given him quite a nest egg for retirement.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Here’s what the online <a href=#><i>Catholic Encyclopedia</i></a> has to say about Benedict IX: “The nephew of his two immediate predecessors, Benedict IX was a man of very different character to either of them. He was a disgrace to the Chair of Peter.”</p><p>When the organization you used to be in charge of writes an official history of itself—complete with entries dealing with the Crusades, witch hunts, and the Thirty Years’ War—and the word “disgrace” is used in the first two sentences of your entry, you’ve probably done something awful to deserve it.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-41638 alt="Benedict IX Crusades" width=800 height=726 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/benedict-ix-crusades1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-41638 class=wp-caption-text>The <a href=#>entry</a> on the Crusades runs to thousands of words; none of them is “disgrace.”<br>Source: <a href=#>Executed Today</a></p><h2>The Boy Pope</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-41645 alt="Benedict IX Medieval Pope" width=800 height=1116 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/benedict-ix-medieval-pope1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-41645 class=wp-caption-text>This isn’t Benedict IX, and it isn’t a coronation, it’s a resignation. But look at that key! It’s HUGE!<br>Source: <a href=#>Dios CG</a></p><p>As stated above, Benedict IX inherited the papacy, which had already been in his family for a while. See if you can follow this: Benedict IX was the great-grandson of the Roman senatrix Marozia, who was the mistress of Pope Sergius III (look for him in a future installment of this series). Pope John IX was apparently their illegitimate child, and two of Benedict’s uncles immediately preceded him in office.</p><p>The hereditary principle is iffy at the best of times, but Benedict really went out of his way to earn a spot as the worst of the lot. Imagine a teenager—any teenager you know—given an unlimited budget, spiritual and temporal authority over a world religion, and charged with total infallibility so nothing he says is ever wrong by definition.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-41644 alt="Benedict IX Bieber" width=800 height=493 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/benedict-ix-justin-bieber1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-41644 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Dematerialize</a></p><p>If the teenager you’ve been imagining was a boy, it will come as no surprise that Benedict was hosting orgies in the Lateran Palace by the age of 14. According to rival factions in the Church (and, honestly, quite a few of his allies), Benedict IX eventually worked other men and several animals into the orgies.</p><p>Eventually, his behavior got so out of control that a monk, St. Peter Damian, decided to write a book unfavorably contrasting Benedict’s Rome with the biblical Gomorrah and came to the conclusion that sex itself was evil. Damian even called Benedict out by name, referring to him as “a demon from hell in the guise of a priest.” By Pope Bieber’s 18th birthday, an angry mob of Romans had driven him out of the city and off the papal throne.</p><h2>The Adult Pope</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-41640 alt="Benedict IX Darth " width=800 height=500 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/benedict-ix-darth-bane1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-41640 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Schmoes Know</a></p><p>But that’s not the end of the story. It turns out that the deposed Benedict had an awful lot of support in high places, which happens when your domestic policy is, basically, “free sex for everyone!” Just a few weeks after being ousted, Benedict IX was back on the throne as a result of some astute, and terribly boring, political maneuvering.</p><p>He must not have maneuvered hard enough, however, because shortly after his re-installation, a gang of attackers set upon him in an abortive assassination attempt as he celebrated Mass. Benedict survived, probably celebrating his good fortune with another orgy, and presided over a shaken Catholic Church for another eight years, until he was deposed again by a cadre of ambitious cardinals who then installed Pope Sylvester III.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-41636 alt="Benedict IX Battle Scene" width=800 height=494 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/benedict-ix-battle-scene1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-41636 class=wp-caption-text>WWJD? Source: <a href=#>Blogspot</a></p><p>After getting kicked out of Rome for a second time, Benedict decided he quite liked being pope and raised an army to retake the city. You wouldn’t think a gluttonous lech with zero military experience would be able to force his way into a fortified city like Rome and reclaim the throne, but remember—free sex for everyone—it’s possible his enemies’ hearts weren’t in it. Amazingly, Benedict broke with papal tradition and allowed Sylvester III to live, rather than having him strangled and chucked in a river. By the end of 1047, Benedict was back in complete control of the church.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyjsc2em6KbpGK2uQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./heres-how-idina-menzel-manages-to-look-the-same-as-she-did-15-years-ago-rent-maureen-frozen.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here's How Idina Menzel Manages to Look the Same As She Did 15 Years Ago">&larr;
