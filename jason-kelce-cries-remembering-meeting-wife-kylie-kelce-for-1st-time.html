I still remember the moment she walked through the door.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Eagles center</a> got choked up as he remembered the “first instance” he saw Kylie appear at the bar, saying it is “burned in my retina.”</p><p>Jason wiped away tears as he recounted the night for reporters and his family, who were on hand to celebrate his retirement announcement on Monday.</p><p>“It was like she glided through the opening, an aura around her. Then she started talking and I thought, ‘Man, is this what love feels like?’” he said of his spouse. “She was beautiful and smart, serious yet playful. I knew it right away.”</p><p>Jason explained that Kylie, <a href=#>whom he wed in April 2013</a>, has been an integral part of his career with the Eagles, which lasted 13 seasons.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@JasonKelce</a> talking about meeting his wife Kylie for the first time.</p><p>“Man, is this what love feels like?” ❤️ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Z1O7NRe0Eg</a></p><p>— NFL (@NFL) <a href=#>March 4, 2024</a></p><p>“I think it’s no coincidence that I have enjoyed my best years of my career with Kylie by my side. Every accolade I have ever received has come with her in my life,” he continued. “She has brought the best out of me through love, devotion, support, honesty, intelligence, and of course, a swift kick in the ass from time to time.”</p><p>Jason praised Kylie for giving him “three beautiful girls and a life that increasingly brings me more fulfillment off the field than it does on.”</p><p>The Super Bowl champion, who <a href=#>shares daughters</a> Wyatt, 4, Ellie, 3, and Bennet, 12 months, gushed: “We’ve had a great run, Ky.”</p><p>Jason also gave shout-outs to his mom, <strong>Donna Kelce</strong>, his dad, <strong>Ed Kelce</strong>, and his younger brother, <a href=#><strong>Travis Kelce</strong></a>, while discussing his time in the NFL, which began in 2011.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jason-Kelce-Gets-Choked-Up-Remembering-1st-Night-He-Met-Wife-Kylie-Kelce-I-Knew-Right-Away-3.jpg><p>“So, this all brings us here to today,” he said. “Where I announce that I am retiring from the NFL after 13 seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles.”</p><p>He joked, “And today I must admit, I am officially overrated. Vastly overrated. It took a lot of hard work and determination getting here. I have been the underdog my entire career, and I mean this when I say it, I wish I still was. Few things give me such joy as proving someone wrong.”</p><p>Jason, who <a href=#>hinted at his retirement</a> at the end of the 2023 season on several occasions, concluded his message with kind words for his adopted home city.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jason-Kelce-Gets-Choked-Up-Remembering-1st-Night-He-Met-Wife-Kylie-Kelce-I-Knew-Right-Away-2.jpg><p>“It has always been a goal of mine to play my whole career in one city. I couldn’t have dreamt a better one and a better fit if I tried,” he said of Philadelphia. “I don’t know what’s next, but I look forward to the new challenges and opportunities that await, and I know that I carry with me the lessons for my time here and that forever we shall all share the bond of being Philadelphians.”</p><p>Kylie, for her part, previously commented on <a href=#>Jason’s possible retirement</a> during a January appearance on <a href=# rel=noopener>Good Morning America</a>.</p><p>“I think that whatever he does he’s going to be successful in,” Kylie gushed. “I’m not just saying that because I’m his wife. I think that is his personality.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmaOku263xKWanmWTp7amv4yrnKadnZeys7XNoGSmnZWptq%2BzjLCgn51doMattcRmop6kk5p6p7vRZmisrF2ptq6xjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-do-the-oilers-play-la-bamba.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Do the Edmonton Oilers Play &amp;quot;La Bamba&amp;quot;?
