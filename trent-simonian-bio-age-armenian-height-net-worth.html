Well, what most of us don’t know is the story of “Bing Bong” and why it got viral in the first place.</p><p>For a New Yorker, a “bing bong” sound is something they have heard for years as it is the sound used by the MTA trains when they’re alerting passengers to stand clear of the door. Well, for obvious reasons, this is not why the “Bing Bong” trend went viral.</p><p>All credit goes to the guys Trent Simonian and Jack Byrne, the brains behind the Instagram show Sidetalk NYC, which adopts <span>a man-on-the-street technique to interview people. Though the “bing bong” sound has been in Sidetalk intro since 2019, the first person to vocalize it was a Brooklyn-based rapper Nems who said it during the April 10th episode called Coney Island’s finest.</span></p><p>It was from there the phrase started to go viral on TikTok as thousands of the users, including celebrities like John Legend, Lil Nas X, Olivia Rodrigo, Jack Harlow, and Avril Lavigne, joined in on the “Bing Bong” trend where they would recreate various quotes from the Sidetalk episodes.</p><p>In this article, we talk about Trent Simonian, one of the two hosts of the Sidetalk NYC. While we will talk about Trent’s Sidetalk thing, we will also provide details on Tren’s age, net worth, girlfriend, and more.</p><h3><b>Meet Trent Simonian, Sidetalk NYC Host</b></h3><p>The host of Sidetalk NYC, Trent Simonian, thanked Nems for popularizing the phrase “bing bong” during an exclusive chat with Distractify. “Credit to Nems on that one. He kind of turned it from the intro thing into a catchphrase of his,” Trent told to Distractify.</p><p>The success of this “Bing Bong” trend partly goes to New York Knicks as well. On October 21, 2021, Trent and Jack released an episode “Knick Season Opener” celebrating the team’s opening night double-overtime victory over the Boston Celtics where one of the New York Knicks fans says “Bing Bong” into the microphone. The phrase quickly got viral having also been picked up by the official New York Knicks Twitter account.</p><p>Trent and his friend Jack were recently even featured on the New York Post. The title of the article was “How two NYU students blew up the Internet with their NSFW Knicks fans video.”</p><p>In just some months alone, Sidetalk’s socials have seen exponential growth. Sidetalk’s Instagram now has 1.2 million followers and the YouTube page is close to touching the 500 thousand subscribers mark.</p><h3><b>Trent Simonian Age</b></h3><p>Trent Simonian’s age was 19 as of January 2021.</p><h3><b>Is Trent Simonian Armenian?</b></h3><p>While Trent has never revealed anything about him being an “Armenian”, a Twitter user named @girthcontroll tweeted Trent being a young Armenian.</p><p>That being said, we do know that Trent was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. Trent played baseball for Major Phillies while he was in Malibu High School.</p><p>His parents are Len and Kristy.&nbsp; also has two siblings, Taylor (sister) and Trevor (brother).</p><h3><b>Trent Simonian Height</b></h3><p>Sidetalk host looks very tall in all the videos and is definitely above 6 feet in height.</p><h3><b>Trent Simonian Net Worth</b></h3><p>Trent Simonian, along with his friend Jack Byrne, launched Sidetalk as a freshman at New York University.</p><p>Talking to Distractify, Trent revealed that he used to do something similar to Sidetalk in high school where he would interview students and teachers. For him, Sidetalk NYC was a natural extension of what he did in his childhood.</p><p>He said, “Just knowing how interesting New York is and how full of characters New York is, I was like, ‘Why not do that on the biggest scale and bring it to New York City.”</p><p>Recently, Trent and Jack trademarked SIDETALK. They had filed a trademark application for SIDETALK with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on July 2, 2021.</p><p>Furthermore, Trent and Jack have also signed with the talent agency WME and television production company Brillstein Entertainment.</p><p>As of this writing, Trent’s net worth was reported to be under $200 thousand.</p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>When Does Trent Simonian Celebrate His Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p>Trent Simonian celebrates his birthday on the 7th of May every year.</p><ul><li><h4><b>Is Trent Simonian On TikTok, Facebook?</b></h4></li></ul><p>Unfortunately, Trent is not on either social platform.
