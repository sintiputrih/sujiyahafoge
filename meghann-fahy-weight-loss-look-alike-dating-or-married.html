And this time she appears even slimmer than the first moment when fans noticed her weight loss on the </span><i><span>Bold Type</span></i><span> back in 2018.</span></p><p><span>So, what’s her weight loss secret? Also, who’s her look alike? And is she still in the dating game or married? Find answers below.</span></p><h3><b>Is Meghann Fahy Dating Or Married?</b></h3><p><span>Meghann Fahy is dating her </span><i><span>The White Lotus</span></i><span> co-star <a href=#>Leo Woodall</a>. Yes! Though Meghann’s character might be married to Cameron (Theo James) in the second season of the HBO dramedy, it seems she was actually dating Jack (Leo Woodall) in real life.</span></p><p><span>But it wasn’t Meghann who first revealed their relationship. Rather, eagle-eyed fans spotted a comment Meghann left on a photo carousel posted on Woodhall’s Instagram, which read, “I love you! I love these! I love you!” followed by a kissy face. The image showed Woodall’s finger in Fahy’s mouth!</span></p><p><span>Later, Leo also commented back, “Love you right back,” with a heart.</span></p><p><span>Apart from this, fans also noticed Leo commenting “UK loves you back” on&nbsp; Meghann’s IG post noting that she loved the UK</span></p><p><span>“Meghann and Leo 1000 percent. Tons of witnesses. Not a whole lot of secrecy behind this pairing,” an anonymous tipster told </span><i><span>DeuxMoi</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>In case you don’t know who Meghann’s current boyfriend is, Leo Woodall is the sexy Brit who stepped into the acting scene just in 2019. But he’s already appeared in TV series like </span><i><span>Vampire Academy </span></i><span>and the 2021 Tom Holland flick</span><i><span> Cherry</span></i><span> on Apple TV+. And now, he’s portraying Jack on </span><i><span>The White Lotus</span></i><span> season 2 alongside Meghann.</span></p><p><span>His character, Jack was first introduced shirtless by the pool during an evening swim. There, he meets Portia, the young assistant joining her boss Tanya.</span></p><p><span>Now, coming back to Meghann’s dating life, Leo isn’t her first popular boyfriend. Prior to him, the actress dated Billy Magnussen for 5 long years. The two were open about their relationship on socials and everything seemed perfect. Sadly, in early 2022, Meghann deleted all the photos of herself with Billy on Instagram, unfollowed him, and announced the split.</span></p><p><span>Now again, if you don’t know who </span><a href=#><span>Billy Magnussen </span></a><span>is, he is an actor known for his roles in&nbsp; </span><i><span>Into the Woods</span></i><span> (2014), </span><i><span>Birth of the Dragon</span></i><span> (2016), </span><i><span>Game Night</span></i><span> (2018), and </span><i><span>Aladdin</span></i><span> (2019). Also, you might have seen him as “Byron Gogol” in the TV series </span><i><span>Made for Love</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><b>Spoilers Alert:</b><span> In the </span><i><span>White Lotus</span></i><span> finale, Meghann’s character is approached by Ethan and she asked him to walk with her out to a scenic, secluded islet called Isola Bella. Then, something happens between them there — something sexual!</span></p><h3><b>Meghann Fahy Weight Loss</b></h3><p><span>Meghann Fahy has always been on a body maintenance journey. But it was only in 2018 when she appeared in the </span><i><span>Bold Type</span></i><span> season 2, fans noticed her weight loss!</span></p><p><span>“I am soooo excited to see you guys back on my screen and OMG Meghan lost weight. You both look amazing. Meghan became even more gorgeous. I didn’t think that was EVEN possible! HOTNESS,” a user tweeted at the time.</span></p><p><span>And now, fast-forward to 4 years from then, as Meghann graces </span><i><span>The White Lotus</span></i><span> season 2, she looks even slimmer; especially around the face.</span></p><p><span>As of 2022, this blue-eyed beauty was around 57 kg (125 lbs).</span></p><p><span>So, what’s her secret? One word — discipline. Usually, she sets her alarm for 4:15 a.m., chugs down a massive Yeti water bottle, drinks coffee, and goes for&nbsp; Orangetheory or run. “Heavy breathing and sweat give me clarity. If I can’t, I do a breathing exercise on a fancy meditation app, Calm,” she added.</span></p><p><span>Also, she was super into eye patches. Especially, since she was introduced to Skyn, which doesn’t slide or rip. And not to mention, the jade roller. She put it in the freezer and roll it around her face every day. “It’s cold, and I think the pressure that the jade provides is kind of perfect for blood flow and depuffing-and it just feels really good,” she explained.</span></p><p><span>As for her diet, it’s mostly eggs. She even called herself an “omelet girl.”</span></p><h3><b>Meghann Fahy Look Alike</b></h3><p><span>Meghann Fahy looks like her </span><i><span>Joy for Christmas</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>The Bold Type</span></i><span> co-star, Cindy Busby. Coincidentally, the two even had the same love interest, Sam Page, on both shows.</span></p><p><span>Another person who looks like Meghann is JoJo @</span><a href=#><span>iamjojo</span></a><span>, the musician.</span></p><p><span>Also, one can argue that young Connie Britton, who played the high-powered “Nicole” in season one of </span><i><span>White Lotus</span></i><span>, looks a lot like Meghann.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Meghann Fahy Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Meghann Fahy flaunted a net worth of above $3 million in 2022.</span></p><p><span>The actress started her career back in 2008 when she was chosen to fill in for Jennifer Damiano as “Natalie Goodman” in the Arena Stage production of </span><i><span>Next to Normal</span></i><span>. The next year, she then moved with the cast when it moved to the Broadway venue, the </span><i><span>Booth Theatre</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Thereafter, roles keep coming her way.</span></p><p><span>So far, she’s graced over 25 movies and TV shows including </span><i><span>w4m, Jus Add Romance, Deception, The Bracket Theory, </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Miss Sloane</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, her theater performances include </span><i><span>Linda, Lost Girls, Twilight: The Musical, The Unauthorized Autobiography of Samantha Brown</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Next to Normal</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Meghann Fahy?</b></h3><p><span>Meghann Fahy was born on April 25, 1990.
