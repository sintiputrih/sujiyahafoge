I would love to have them myself. I would ask all of the questions that everyone else wondering what happened.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Heche was then briefly hospitalized after she went to a stranger’s house in Fresno, California, and shared nonsensical information with the person who lived here.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Anne Heche Relationship Details</span></strong></h2><p><span>Anne Heche was previously married to cameraman Coleman Laffoon in 2001, with whom she shares a son named Homer, 17, born in 2002 and was divorced after five years.</span></p><p><span>She was also in a relationship with actor James Tupper with whom she also shared 10-year-old son Atlas born in 2009. They split after a decade of staying together.</span></p><p><span>She said, <strong>“James and I have shared a great life together and have many wonderful memories. We’ve enjoyed working together, most recently on the Brave where he joins us for our two mind-bending final episodes.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The joint statement also added, <strong>“Relationships change and grow; we’re taking time for that. We care very much for each other and plan to continue raising our two beautiful boys in love and harmony. Thank you for allowing us privacy as our family evolves.”</strong> The two were not married but eternally engaged.</span></p><p><span>This year, the actress Anne and skincare mogul Peter Thomas Roth was spotted several times together in Hamptons looking more than friends.
