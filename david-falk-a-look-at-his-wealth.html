Often considered one of the most influential agents in NBA history, Falk became widely recognized as the second most powerful figure in the league during the 1990s, following commissioner David Stern. His career in this field began in 1975.</p><p>With an estimated net worth of $50 million as of late 2016, David Falk has amassed significant wealth through his successful career as a player agent. Additionally, his involvement as a film producer and author has further contributed to his financial success.</p><h3>David Falk’s Rise to Success</h3><p>David Falk, the second of three children in a middle-class Jewish family, grew up in New York and attended Douglas MacArthur High School. Despite his mother’s hope for him to become a basketball player, he pursued his education at Syracuse University, where he graduated with a degree in economics in 1972. He also earned a J.D. from the George Washington University Law School in 1975.</p><p>Honing his skills, Falk began his career as an unpaid intern with former pro tennis player, Donald Dell, in 1974. He later accepted a full-time job offer from Dell, marking the start of his work as an NBA agent. Notably, Falk’s career took off when he signed John Lucas as the No.1 pick in the 1976 NBA Draft and orchestrated a million-dollar shoe deal for James Worthy in 1982, leveraging connections with North Carolina University.</p><p>In 1984, Falk, along with Dell, signed Michael Jordan as the No.3 NBA Draft pick and went on to secure a groundbreaking $500,000 deal between Nike and Jordan. Notably, his influence also led to Jordan signing a $30 million contract with Nike in 1997. Subsequently, in 1992, Falk created his own company, Falk Associates Management Enterprises (FAME), which became a dominating force in the NBA. He later sold it to the entertainment group SFX for $100 million in 1998 and served as chairman of the SFX Sports Group from 1999 to 2001.</p><p>Falk’s client roster has included some of the most notable players in the NBA such as Kenny Anderson, Vin Baker, Charles Barkley, Mike Bibby, Patrick Ewing, and Allen Iverson. Beyond his agent work, Falk has also ventured into film production, being involved in movies like “Space Jam” (1996), “Michael Jordan to the Max” (2000), and “The Youngest Guns” (2004). In 2009, he authored his first book, “The Bald Truth”.</p><p>On the personal front, Falk is married to Rhonda and they have two daughters. They currently reside in Rockville, Maryland. Falk is also known for his philanthropy, having made significant donations to various institutions, including a $5 million contribution to Syracuse University, which led to the establishment of The David B. Falk Center for Sport Management in 2008.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$50 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>1950</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Long Island, New York City, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Sports agent</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Syracuse University, George Washington University Law School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Rhonda Frank</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Daina Falk, Jocelyn Falk</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Pearl Falk</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmibmq6ZmXqnrcukZJplnKS8rHnArWShoaNixKaty62faA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jayson-tatum-relationship-with-girlfriend-ella-mai-in-2022-as-fans-are-concerned-over-son-deuce-mother.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jayson Tatum Relationship With Girlfriend Ella Mai As Fans Are Concerned Over Son Deuce Mother">&larr;
