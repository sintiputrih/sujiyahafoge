Charles’ cult was responsible for numerous atrocious offenses in the USA during the late 1960s. The Manson family, with his father at its helm, perpetrated a series of terrible murders that jolted the world.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Valentine_Michael_Manson></span>Who is Valentine Michael Manson?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Michael, born 15 April 1968, was the result of Charles Manson’s affair with Mary Brunner, the first member of his cult. He was given the same name as the protagonist in Charles’ favorite book entitled, Stranger in a Strange Land.</p><p>Valentine Michael Manson, now commonly called Michael Brunner, is said to be the son of the infamous cult leader Charles Manson and Mary Brunner.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Mary-Brunner-Charles-Manson.webp alt="Mary Brunner, Charles Manson" width=596 height=792 data-sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>He was born in Topanga Canyon, which is located in Los Angeles County, California, USA. At that time, his father was serving a sentence at McNeil Island Penitentiary in California.</p><p>Michael was born in California, but was taken in by his maternal grandparents in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, whom he called “Mom and Dad”. His grandparents changed his name when he was nine years old, to Sunstone Hawk or Pooh Bear.</p><p>He has kept away from the public eye and attempted to distance himself from the Manson name so he can live a peaceful life.</p><p>Valentine Michael Manson had a difficult time staying distant from the cult. People would often discover his identity and torment him, going as far as making death threats. It has been a continuous struggle for him to get past these threats.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Parents></span>Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Michael’s mother, Mary Brunner, spent a lot of time in prison. She had been a part of a police clash in 1971 that was meant to liberate her husband, who was the cult leader. As he was taken away from them when he was a year and a half old, he has never had a bond with them.</p><p>While speaking about his mother in an interview, Michael said:</p><p>She was always my ‘sister,’ but now she’s just my kid’s grandma.</p><p>Valentine Michael Manson had no connection whatsoever with his father, who passed away in a prison cell on 19 November 2017. The cultist had been incarcerated for forty years for the murders of LaBianca and <a href=# rel=noopener>Sharon Tate</a>. Charles Manson was 83 years old at the time of his death.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Charles-Manson.webp alt="Charles Manson" width=2452 height=2452 data-sizes="(max-width: 2452px) 100vw, 2452px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Siblings></span>Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Valentine Michael Manson had two siblings, both of whom were step-siblings. His father was married to two separate women; between 1955 and 1958. One of his wives was Rosalie Jean Willis. From this marriage, they had a son named Charles Manson, Jr., who was born in 1956.</p><p>When his mother remarried, he changed his name to Jay White, using his stepfather’s surname. Jay passed away in 1993 when he took his own life.</p><p>In 1959, Charles and Candy Stevens tied the knot. In 1963, they split up, but before that Candy had given birth to their son, Charles Luther Manson. As was the case with his other children, Luther modified his name and has steered clear of public attention throughout his life.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Charles-Manson-son.webp alt="Charles Manson son" width=1600 height=1067 data-sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Not much has been revealed about his occupation since the year 1993. However, in his last interview with the <a href=# rel=noopener>Los Angeles Times,</a> he mentioned that he had taken part in the military in the 1860s after completing his training. Michael was also self-employed for quite some time and resided in Germany for the majority of his life.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Personal_Life></span>Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Since Michael has chosen to keep his life away from the limelight, there isn’t much information regarding his personal life. However, he is assumed to be around 55 years old and is probably married with kids.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Valentine_Michael_Mansons_Net_Worth></span>Valentine Michael Manson’s Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He has not made public his financial situation yet. Popular Bio states that his supposed <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> is $100k, but this can not be confirmed and is therefore not a reliable source.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXPraarp16YvK57z2itmqSVo8GqusRmpKKbmJayrXnMmqWsp55k</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nfl-news-brian-robinson-jr-after-getting-shot-twice-in-the-leg-washington-commanders-rookie-rb-makes-a-miraculous-comeback-after-six-weeks.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="After Getting Shot Twice In The Leg, Washington Commanders Rookie RB Makes AMiraculous Comeback Aft">&larr;
