However, because the Duggars work differently (remember, this is a family of more than 30 people who, among other things, save first kisses for marriage), Jim Bob Duggar and Michelle Duggar, the family's patriarch and matriarch, set some contentious social media and dating guidelines for their children, who are all raised with steadfast, traditional Christian principles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Money Did The Duggars Make During Their Decade-Plus Reality TV Run?</a></span></p><p>Needless to say, the conservative Duggar family is keeping tight control over the content their children consume and share online. While they are allowed to have accounts on some social media platforms such as Instagram, many are wondering if they have already expanded their social media reach to TikTok. Are they moving forward to a more mainstream approach now to keep up with their fans?</p><h2 id=what-are-the-duggars-39-social-media-rules>What Are The Duggars' Social Media Rules?</h2><p>When it comes to what their children are allowed and not allowed to do, the Duggar family has some strict standards. The girls are prohibited from wearing pants while residing in the home and are not permitted to spend any alone time with a significant other prior to marriage.</p><p>In fact, it appears that the Duggar children are not even permitted to leave the house unaccompanied. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">social media and internet usage are some of the most rigid rules to abide by,</a> especially for unmarried children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jim Bob Duggar, the head of the family, explained that many of the younger boys are given phones that don’t have browsing capabilities.</p><p>For the unmarried Duggar boys who do have cellphones, they cannot access the internet or even download any apps without Jim’s approval.</p><p>Many fans think the restriction was implemented as a result of Josh Duggar, the oldest Duggar boy, <a href=#>sexually assaulting five young girls</a>. The intention is to prevent them from being "misled."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Duggar Insider Says Everyone Knew Josh Duggar Was Problematic, But They All Ignored It</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Also, the Duggar children are not allowed to have a social media account before they are engaged or married. And even when they put a ring on it, that doesn’t necessarily mean they all rush to sign up on social media, trying to expand their online presence.</p><p>Considering the family’s faith-based beliefs, it wouldn’t come as a surprise that they are only allowed to be on social media platforms under certain conditions.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>It Turns Out The Duggars Don’t Have A Rule Against This Expression Of Individuality</a></span></p><p>Nevertheless, many of the adult Duggars have Instagram accounts and some are on Twitter as well while a few even have web pages of their own. They keep their fans updated through their social media accounts, where they share photos of family outings, date nights, and other relatable moments.</p><p>Now that these platforms are a trend to grow followers, have the Duggars already ventured to TikTok?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=do-any-of-the-duggars-have-tiktok>Do Any Of The Duggars Have TikTok?</h2><p>The Duggar family has been spreading their social media influence lately as they have shared lives and projects on varying platforms and services including Instagram and YouTube. Yet, there was one platform that they hadn’t conquered until when <a href=#>Jinger Duggar stepped her foot into the TikTok</a> pedal and found them to be quite beneficial.</p><p>For many, it would not make sense why the Duggars don’t have celebrity TikTok accounts. But in order to understand why most of them aren’t even online, it is essential to remember that they have quite a few infamous and super conservative strict rules, which mostly have to do with dating and modesty.</p><p>But for Jinger, the rebel of the flock who flaunted <a href=#>her anti-Duggar activities</a> publicly, TikTok can be used to channel videos that she and her husband Jeremy hope to bring “joy” to their fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She posted a video on her new TikTok account, saying: “Hey guys, welcome to Amazed. I’m excited that we’ll be able to show you videos to brighten your day. It’s gonna be a lot of fun, so stay tuned and you might be able to see some grilling as well, which brings me joy!”</p><p>Although Jinger was the first Duggar to have a TikTok account, it appears that fans weren’t in full support to her new venture. May are thinking that she and her husband are building up a following to “sell the pages” they’ve created once they have a lot of followers.</p><p>Some also questioned about her husband’s beliefs and her family’s stand on Josh’s situation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, only they know for sure what they plan to do with their accounts, it is possible that they are just trying to explore the new social media platform, and they could possibly monetize them. But with the negative attention she received after creating her account, it seems TikTok might not be the platform fit for them.</p><p>As for the other Duggar children, one wouldn’t expect a family so conservative and modest as the Duggars to have a presence on TikTok. We’ll just wait what the future holds for them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dqbWmecOunqCZoqh6sLqMraCkrJ%2BgfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./heather-staal.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Heather Staal">&larr;
