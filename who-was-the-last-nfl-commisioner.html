Goodell became the eighth commissioner in the history of the National Football League (NFL). Before him, the league's chief executive was called the league president. The first head of the league was Ralph Hay, the owner of the Canton Bulldogs. Jim Thorpe, a renowned athlete, served as the inaugural president of the league. Joseph Carr, owner of the Columbus Panhandles, became the league president in 1921 and introduced standardized schedules and a standard player's contract.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>From its founding in 1920 to Roger Goodell, there have only been eight men who have headed the NFL. Some notable leaders of the NFL who made significant contributions to the game include Jim Thorpe, Joe Carr, Bert Bell, and Pete Rozelle. Each of them played a key role in shaping the league and its success.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Pete Rozelle, in particular, was unexpectedly chosen as the NFL's new commissioner in 1960 after a prolonged search for a successor to Bert Bell. Despite initial doubts, Rozelle grew into the job and became widely recognized as the premier commissioner of all professional sports. He is credited with successfully negotiating a television contract that greatly improved the NFL's financial outlook. Rozelle also acted decisively in suspending players involved in gambling allegations, ensuring the integrity of pro football.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Moreover, Rozelle played a crucial role in ending the AFL-NFL inter-league struggle in the 1960s. His leadership and strategic decision-making led to the successful merger of the two leagues, resulting in the formation of the modern NFL as we know it today. Rozelle's achievements and contributions to the game of football were recognized with his induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Following Pete Rozelle's tenure, there have been subsequent commissioners who have further shaped the NFL. Paul Tagliabue served as commissioner from 1989 to 2006, overseeing the league's expansion and growth during his tenure. He focused on expanding the league's reach internationally and strengthening its financial stability.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Then, in 2006, Roger Goodell assumed the role of commissioner and has been serving in that capacity since then. Goodell has faced numerous challenges during his tenure, including player safety concerns, labor disputes, and controversies surrounding player conduct. He has also worked towards expanding the league's global presence and implementing new policies to ensure the integrity of the game.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Roger Goodell is the current and eighth commissioner of the NFL, assuming office in 2006. He follows a line of esteemed leaders such as Jim Thorpe, Joe Carr, Bert Bell, Pete Rozelle, and Paul Tagliabue, each of whom has played a significant role in shaping the NFL's history and success. Goodell continues to lead the league, addressing the challenges and opportunities that come with being the chief executive of America's most popular sport.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn6hlp5bAbsDHnmSlmaOpeq%2Byy2aaqKWdnsCqu82eqQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./alicia-minshew-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-580415-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alicia Minshew Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr;
