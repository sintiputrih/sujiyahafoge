He gained fame and his name made rounds worldwide due to his outstanding multiple winning streaks and achievements on numerous world championships. In his entire boxing career, he has compiled multiple world championship victories that highlighted 3 weight classes including the unified Super WBA, WBC, Ring Magazine, and Lineal Middleweight Titles. Moreover, he has also acquired the IBF Title since May 2019, and the WBA Regular Super Middleweight Title since December 2018. He was ranked as the world’s best active boxer and got various recognitions and titles such as becoming the pound for pound, by BoxRec, third by The Ring, and eighth by the Boxing Association of America (BAA).</p><p>Álvarez also peaked the top as the world’s best active middleweight by BoxRec and was also recognized by the Transitional Boxing Ranking Boards (TBRB). In his early years and shortly after debuting as a professional boxer, he was able to knock out 11 out of his 13 opponents, all of which were older than him at the time. He recorded another victory in January 2006 after winning a fight against IBF Lightweight champion Miguel Vázquez, which made his career evidently more successful and dominating in the boxing industry. Two years after, he defeated Vázquez in a rematch during which a history was made when his other 6 brothers also fought on that same night. As for his style play, he’s known for his excellent execution as a counterpuncher.
