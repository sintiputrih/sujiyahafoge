Their lawyer Sydney Irmas explained, "We contend the use of airplanes in close proximity to people and pyrotechnics are such that a person has to have all their faculties,' attorney Sydney Irmas said Wednesday.

She said, "Because acting is such an odd world, I also grew up as a child of actors and writers. My mom's a screenwriter and before that she was an actress, and my father was an actor, my step-father was a director so I was on sets a lot as a kid. I loved the magic of the set. You walk in and it's a living room and you walk outside and it's just a piece of wood held up by another piece of wood. There's a lot of magic involved in movies that as a child I really appreciated."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoyjmKynnmK5prXGoapmnpGptaa%2BjKygrKyVp3qlscCtn2abmJa7qLHDZquhnV2brrTAjK2gpp2jYq61edGim6CdnaS7tXnHop6hZaOprrO%2FjKWgn51dm7yzsdWeqWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./new-td-garden-bag-policy-might-affect-excitement-level-for-aew-big-business.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="New TD Garden Bag Policy Might Affect Excitement Level For AEW Big Business">&larr;
