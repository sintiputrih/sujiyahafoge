Marbles is often trending on social media, but most news is about her fans missing her and asking her to return to the internet.</p><p>However, it seems like Marbles has been enjoying her life outside the spotlight with her family and dogs.</p><p>Recently, a picture of Marbles and her fianc√©, Julien Solomita, with a fan went viral on social media.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jenna Marbles‚Äô comeback speculated in 2022</h2><p>On July 27, 2022, a Twitter user named @saaltinthewound shared a picture of themselves with Marbles and Solomita. They stood in the middle of the couple, who were in a casual outfit and masked up.</p><p>The star of the picture was Marbles, who looked very different than she did in 2020. She had a platinum bob in contrast to the waist-length hair that she previously sported.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/jenna.jpeg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Jenna Marbles‚Äô viral picture with a fan and Julien Solomita was posted on July 27, 2022. (Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter</a>)</p><p>Similarly, even though she was wearing a mask, it was evident that she was smiling widely for the picture. The photo soon went viral, with many people retweeting it and sharing it on TikTok.</p><p>The fans were happy to see Marbles after so long and wished for her return to the internet. Many asked for her comeback, saying it was about time that she returned.</p><p>Many asked @saaltinthewound if she asked Marbles to return to YouTube, and they joked about it. They said, ‚ÄúI asked her abt coming back, and her and julien spit on me and then threw me down the stairs.‚Äù</p><p>Similarly, after the photo went viral, many questioned @saaltinthewound if they asked for permission to share the picture from Solomita and Marbles. While @saaltinthewound confirmed that she got the consent from the couple, many had a hard time believing it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>in regards to the jenna marbles pic that has gone viral, this was stated by julien himself! the photo was consensual and fine to be posted ü§ç <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/tP0ZX1GKzD</a></p>‚Äî em (@bestofaloy) <a href=# rel=noopener>July 28, 2022</a></figure><p>As a result, Solomita took to TikTok to assure their fans and followers that @saaltinthewound had their permission to click and post the picture on the internet. He did so via a comment on one of the viral TikToks reacting to the photo.</p><p>He clarified that whenever he and his partner take a picture with the fans, they are implying that they are okay with it being posted on the internet. He then thanked and appreciated everyone for looking out for Marbles and her privacy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What happened to Jenna Marbles?</h2><p>The beloved YouTuber announced in June 2020 that she would be on a hiatus indefinitely. Her break came after the mass cancellation of Jeffree Star and Shane Dawson following the drama with <a href=#>James Charles</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In a now-deleted video, she apologized for her past problematic behavior. She stated that she was leaving the platform because she was not having fun with her work, which was her intended intention.&nbsp;</p><p>She then discreetly shut her Instagram and Twitter accounts a few months later. It is uncertain if she will ever return to social media, but it is clear that many of her fans adore and miss her.</p><p>The only glimpse we got of her was on Valentine‚Äôs Day 2022 when Solomita posted a picture of the two on his Instagram. However, Marbles herself has never been active since June 2020.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Colleen Ballinger Claims She Lost Broadway Role amid Grooming Accusations</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>‚ÄúI was really sad about that,‚Äù said the YouTuber.</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Colleen-Ballinger-Broadway.jpg alt decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/colleen-ballinger/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Colleen Ballinger</a> has been facing backlash, and multiple companies have ended ties with her since she was accused of grooming young viewers.</p><p>The YouTuber has since been sharing her ‚Äúdark times‚Äù following the accusations. Now, the YouTuber has opened up about how she lost out on a Broadway audition last year over her grooming allegations.</p><p>On Thursday, January 11, 2024, Ballinger <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xPRxUghF7Q" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">uploaded</a> a new vlog on her YouTube channel titled ‚ÄòMy Big Audition!‚Äô In the new video, she went into the details of losing out on a big Broadway opportunity.</p><p>She mentioned that the auditions didn‚Äôt work out and was sad about it. She also said that she lost the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/broadway-show/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Broadway</a> opportunity right after she was accused of grooming, an accusation which she claimed was made up.</p><p>She stated, ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt work out and I was really sad about that. I‚Äôm not going to get super into it but obviously, a lot happened last year, a lot was said last year. I lost that opportunity right after a story came out about me that was just completely made up and it is what it is.‚Äù</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Colleen-Ballinger-Broadway.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Colleen Ballinger talks about losing out on a Broadway opportunity in her new YouTube video (Photo: YouTube)</p><p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre moving forward. I already got to do a Broadway show, and I‚Äôm so grateful for that. What a cool, wonderful, and beautiful experience that was for me,‚Äù Ballinger added. She said she was grateful for that opportunity as it was her ultimate dream to be on Broadway.</p><p>Her statement read, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so grateful that I ever got to do it because my ultimate dream, if you know me at all since I was a little girl, was to be on Broadway.‚Äù She further reflected on the opportunity and admitted that she was ‚Äúexcited to see that dream come true again.‚Äù</p><p>But Ballinger then reconciled with the fact that the ‚Äúdream has already come true.‚Äù As she continued, she said she finally understood why her viewers wanted an update, as she had conveyed so much of the audition process in her videos throughout 2023.</p><p>She stated, ‚ÄúI shared that audition process with you, so I understand why everyone is so curious to know what happened, but I‚Äôm not going to sit here and have a pity party about it. I definitely already had a pity party about that one, believe me, and now I‚Äôm just trying to look at everything with a different lens.‚Äù</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/exclusive/jeffree-star-collen-ballinger-grooming/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Ballinger‚Äôs grooming accusations</a> first surfaced in 2020 when Adam McIntyre, a former fan and YouTuber, spoke up against her. He accused her of grooming him and claimed that her behavior towards her fans wasn‚Äôt good.</p><p>However, nobody believed McIntyre then, and many of Ballinger‚Äôs fans defended her and accused McIntyre of lying. This led to the topic being faded and forgotten until McIntyre uploaded another video about Ballinger on June 4, 2023.</p><p>In the video, which was over an hour long, he opened up about his relationship with Ballinger and how he felt she was using him and other fans as per her needs. Likewise, in another video, he mentioned being a part of a group chat with Ballinger and other fans.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>McIntyre claimed that when all of this was happening, Ballinger was already in her 30s, whereas most of the fans in the group chat were between 14 and 16. But the age didn‚Äôt stop Ballinger from commenting on their looks, encouraging bullying, and asking inappropriate questions.</p><p>‚ÄúThis woman groomed me,‚Äù McIntyre mentioned. Additionally, McIntyre showed multiple screenshots of his time in the group chats. Some of the pictures showed Ballinger asking very inappropriate questions.</p><p>As McIntyre went on, he claimed that Ballinger, also known as Miranda Sings, used love-bombing to make him feel special and praised and encouraged him to run her social media handles without pay. All this ultimately ended their friendship.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>McIntyre later realized that Ballinger had been grooming him and decided to stand up and talk about his experience. Since he spoke against her, other fans in the group chat have also opened up about their experiences of being groomed or used by Ballinger.</p><p>In addition to Ballinger, fans have accused the YouTuber‚Äôs <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/rachel-ballinger/ rel="noreferrer noopener">sister, Rachel</a>, and her best friend, Kory DeSoto, of grooming. All three have received major backlash since the grooming scandal came to light, and many sponsors have ended their contracts.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Bruno Mars‚Äô Relationship with Girlfriend Jessica Caban Reportedly in Shambles</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>‚ÄúThey are living separate lives,‚Äù said the source.</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bruno-Mars-Girlfriend.jpg alt="Bruno Mars‚Äô Relationship with Girlfriend Jessica Caban Reportedly in Shambles" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>It looks like the end is near for <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/bruno-mars/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Bruno Mars</a>‚Äô long-time relationship with his girlfriend, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/jessica-caban/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Jessica Caban</a>.</p><p>As per reports, the American singer-songwriter and his girlfriend‚Äôs relationship might end up in a break up, considering the two are reportedly living apart as of this moment.</p><p>On Wednesday, January 10, 2024, an inside source close to the couple told <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/25315133/bruno-mars-girlfriend-jessica-caban-relationship/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Sun</a> that Mars and Caban weren‚Äôt together to celebrate Christmas and New Year‚Äôs Eve.

They are living separate lives, so it doesn‚Äôt bode well for their relationship. It feels like things are fizzling out between them.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúThey have so much history together, but we aren‚Äôt sure whether they will be able to save things this time.

An anonymous tipster had told the popular Instagram gossip account, in one of their <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18122274628323340/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q&A sessions</a>, that Mars and Caban‚Äôs relationship was fizzling out.</p><p>They wrote, ‚ÄúBruno Mars (ex) girlfriend not wearing any engagement ring? Could it be they split!???‚Äù To this info, DeuxMoi replied, ‚ÄúOMG we just talked about this on this week‚Äôs podcast episode. We could have used this info.‚Äù</p><p>The engagement in question refers to a previous report by DeuxMoi, where a source claimed that Mars and Caban had gotten engaged. The claim was agreed upon by Caban‚Äôs friend, who mentioned that Caban had been donning an engagement ring for a while.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/colleen-ballinger-broadway-1.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">DeuxMoi‚Äôs Instagram story where a tipster mentioned about Bruno Mars and Jessica Caban‚Äôs alleged split (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>Returning to the topic, on DeuxMoi‚Äôs Q&A session on January 10, 2024, another tipster <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18007043366241705/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mentioned</a> the same thing reported by The Sun. The tipster wrote, ‚ÄúBruno Mars and Jessica spent Christmas and New Year apart! Getting more obvious they split.‚Äù</p><p>As of this writing, neither Mars nor Caban has responded to the claims of their relationship fizzling out. The singer‚Äôs reps have also not made a comment. That said, Mars often likes to keep the details of his dating life away from the media.</p><p>Coming over to Mars‚Äô relationship with his girlfriend, they first met in 2010 at a restaurant in New York. At the time, there were reports of them dating, officially confirmed via Caban‚Äôs tweet on October 7, 2012, when she shared a picture of herself and Mars.</p><p>Since then, the two have always been together, being each other‚Äôs support system. However, they did all this and more while keeping their togetherness out of the eye of the media and public.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bruno-Mars-Girlfriend.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Bruno Mars‚Äô girlfriend Jessica Caban‚Äôs recent picture with no engagement ring amid rumored engagement news (Photo: Twitter)</p><p>Nonetheless, Mars occasionally mentioned Caban in his acceptance speeches and talked about their relationship in some of his interviews. For instance, when he won the Best Pop Vocal Album award in 2014, he said, ‚ÄúJessica, I love you‚Äù onstage.</p><p>Years later, when he won the Record of the Year award in 2018, he went onstage and gushed about his life partner. He said, ‚ÄúMy lady, Jessica, I love you, baby. Thank you for being my rock and being on my side throughout this whole process.‚Äù</p><p>Likewise, during his 2016 interview with Rolling Stone, he was asked if he would propose to Caban sometime soon. He replied that she was his best friend and they were ‚Äújust happy.‚Äù His full answer read, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs my best friend. My rock. What‚Äôs wrong with that? We‚Äôre just happy.‚Äù</p><p>As years passed, things seemed blissful between the love birds, with one rumor claiming they were expanding their family. But these pregnancy rumors were never confirmed. And since Mars and Caban aren‚Äôt parents yet, it can be regarded as false.</p><p>Fast forward to 2024, Mars and Caban‚Äôs relationship is now in question. As mentioned earlier, reports claim they are living a separate life, hinting there might be a possible break up.
