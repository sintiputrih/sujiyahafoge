Prue found Jürgen’s coffee and chocolate Murder at the Opera creation “sensational” but Paul complained about the flavours, saying: “I like it, but I don’t love it.”</p><p>Afterwards the IT professional said sadly: “There were three handshakes in the tent – but I didn’t get one. The bottom line is, I’m in trouble now.”</p><p>Things then looked up hugely for Jürgen in the technical challenge, in which his sablé Breton tart won first place.</p><p>“That went very well, what a relief,” he said afterwards. “I will sleep better tonight.”</p><p>But his joy was short-lived, after his themed entremets display showstopper failed to impress as much as his rivals’ did, with the judges calling his choice of colours “bland”.</p><p>They also said his Torrii Gate in the Sea needed more decoration on the Japanese boats.</p><p>In contrast, Chigs’ apple-themed effort was deemed “exceptional” and Crystelle was moved to tears when her fruity creation was described as “flawless”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.examinerlive.co.uk/news/tv/article21568834.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Paul-Hollywood-is-preparing-for-the-return-of-The-Great-British-Bake-Off.jpg><p>While the other bakers gasped in shock when it was revealed he would leave, Jürgen took the news on the chin.</p><p>And fans couldn’t believe it either and all said the same about the final.</p><p>Nicky Price said: “Recovering from GBBOreally really thought they were going to put all four through to the final.</p><p>Will Hoggan said: “Won’t be watching the final now! Voting off Juergen.”</p><p>Another, @cherrysval, said: “couldnt you have just had a 4 person finale just this once??”</p><p>Lucy Scott Traybakes agreed, adding: “They should’ve let all four go through. They were all amazing today.”</p><p>Jurgen was magnanimous in his exit, though.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.examinerlive.co.uk/incoming/article22187264.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_FEVo4m3WUAImVknjfif.jpg><p>He said: ““I feel kind of ok, I kind of saw it coming, I think the others are more shocked than I am,” he explained. “It has been incredible and I have really enjoyed being here. I have made friends for life, and I will be with them in spirit.”</p><p>This year, because of coronavirus, the bakers all lived together in a bubble for the entire time.</p><p>Showing his good nature, Jürgen said he felt thrilled for his friends for making it through to the end. “I am really proud for the other three bakers to be in the final, they deserve it.</p><p>“We helped each other out all the way and during practice there was never any spark of competition. By the time we got to the semi-final we were close friends and we all appreciated each others’ unique baking styles and personalities. I am so looking forward to watching the final but I know I will be quite anxious for them.”</p><p>Amazon Prime has thousands of original series, sport documentaries and films you can subscribe to watch here for just £7.99/ month plus a free month trial included.</p><p>Disney+ is here in the UK and if paid for an annual subscription can save viewers 15%, giving you access to Disney and Pixar films, and popular series such as The Mandalorian.

Plans range from £5.99 to £13.99 a month. No extra costs, no contracts.</p><p>He said his high points was learning so many new techniques and low points were bad comments from Paul Hollywood. But he added: “‘Paul called me the ‘Konditormeister’ which for me was a real honour. In Germany you do many years apprenticeship and training to get that accolade.”</p><p>Jurgen, who describes himself as “nerdy, open-minded and dedicated”, said he planned to return to his IT job.</p><p>“I didn’t go into the Bake Off wanting a career change, but it will be interesting to see what creative possibilities come my way.”</p><p>He said he looked forward to being reunited in Brighton with his wife Sophia and son Benjamin, with whom he plays trombone in a band. “I missed having meals with my family, and playing music together.”</p><p></p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tompGgsm67xZ9kn5meqHqlsdWaqq2ZpJqxbq3FrZyrZaedvG7DxKerZqelqXqwsoybmKSdXaSzp3nTqKWin5ipeqK%2FjK%2Bgnq%2BVp8BurculZKyZqWLAornEZquhoZ6ceqKuzq6rZp6Zo66tew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./brandon-t-jackson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brandon T.
