For many stars they opt to keep their personal lives private; kids stay out of the spotlight until they’re sure they can handle it, or they step into it of their own accord. Other stars take the opposite approach and let their young ones reign supreme in the limelight of family life. It’s easier to do the latter when both parents are famous. Just look at<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt</a>! For Kyra Sedgwick and Kevin Bacon, one of the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> longest-lasting couples</a>, one might expect that their kids would have grown up in the center of all the world’s attention. They’re both well known and well-liked, winning awards and accolades with many of the movies that they do. However, they didn’t actually find themselves with famous children until much later. The kids grew into it on their own, choosing what they wanted out of their lives. Because of that, we don’t actually know a whole lot about them!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Celebrity Kids Are Following In Their Famous Parents' Footsteps</a></span></p><h2 id=sosie-bacon-has-enjoyed-the-spotlight>Sosie Bacon Has Enjoyed The Spotlight</h2><p>In fact, she’s one of the youngest Bacons to get <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sucked into the Hollywood hills’ fame</a> and fortune. With her dad by her side, though, she knew how to navigate it, even if she probably didn’t understand all the dad hubbub. Apparently Sosie Bacon never “watch [her parents’] movies and stuff that often, ‘cause when I was really little, they were kind of inappropriate, so I kind of just, like, stayed in that pattern. But I just watched Mystic River recently, and I thought my dad was incredible in that,“ proving that taking the advice from Dad was a good call. And mom too! No doubt her mother gave her some assistance when it came to navigating relationships, both professional and personal, in the world of fame and fortune. She’s done quite well for herself, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hailie Mathers And 19 Other Celeb Kids Who Grew Up To Become Bombshells</a></span></p><p>Sosie Bacon is an actor, and a very successful one at that. “Loverboy, directed by Kevin Bacon and starring Sedgwick, marked Sosie’s first foray into acting… She also worked with her mom on The Closer and again with both her parents on Story of a Girl, with Sedgwick directing and Kevin starring,” proving that the genes really are in the family. She isn’t just working with the family anymore, though. She’s moved on and found herself in a perfect position with Narcos, and a variety of other big-name tv shows. We’re sure that she’ll find herself in movies again one day when she moves on from this current recurring role! Is there any doubt that she’ll pick something up, though? No. When you’re the daughter of Hollywood icons like Kyra Sedgwick and Kevin Bacon you’re sure to find yourself getting more role offers than you know what to do with! And the best part is that she’s so down to earth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=travis-bacon-is-doing-well-too>Travis Bacon Is Doing Well Too</h2><p>But he’s one of the only Bacons not involved in the acting world. While he has one or two credits under his belt, he found <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a different aspect of movie making</a> that drew him in: music composing. Travis Bacon is currently playing with the band Black Anvil. He was also a part of a group for many years which played his own blend of punk and heavy metal. Don’t think of him as a one-sound pony, though. He managed to compose songs for a variety of movies, and has an IMDb page which is just as long as his sisters! (Well, almost.) On top of all of that, he also has a recording company which has no doubt come in handy throughout the course of his musical history. While he doesn’t have the same kind of interest in acting, the family still loves him all the same. We’re waiting for him to make a return to acting with his sister, though! Bring the family together again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Actors Who First Gained Success As Musicians</a></span></p><p>Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick have been together for years, and there’s no surprise why. The two of them are incredibly compatible and close-knit, and they have the best kind of partnership: an equal one. Bacon and Sedgwick are independent creators, and because of that, they know how to collaborate. Luckily they’ve used their collaboration skills both creatively and familially. Their kids have grown up surrounded by love and compassion. While they might have tried to keep them away from the big wide world of Hollywood, they didn’t succeed. Sosie Bacon has turned into just as successful an actor as her mother, while Travis Bacon is finding his own path in the gleaming world of heavy metal. The two of them might have started off working in their parents’ projects and passion pictures, but they’ve branched out over time and turned into their own successful artists. We’re excited to see where both of them go from here!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Bacon Resorts To Extreme Violence In New Clip From His Latest Thriller</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2BmecqeraKmXZeupLvNrGScoJmhsbOxzWaYp5xdrLWiwIydpmasmJrGbrDOaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-minnie-mills-sean-kaufman-girlfriend-and-relationship-timeline.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Minnie Mills?
