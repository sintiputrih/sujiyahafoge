Congestion, your nasal anatomy, and sleep apnea can cause you to breathe through your mouth. Sometimes people produce more saliva than they can swallow.</span></span><h2>Does drooling mean you slept good?</h2>According to My Fit Magazine, drooling is a sign of good rest and positive dreams. Drool indicates an uninterrupted REM (rapid eye movement) phase of sleep. It's during the REM phase that you go into the deepest sleep.

Medical conditions such as acid reflux and pregnancy can increase saliva production. Allergies, tumors, and above-the-neck infections such as strep throat, tonsil infection, and sinusitis can all impair swallowing.<h2>Do you drool more when tired?</h2>Because drool is your saliva escaping your mouth unintentionally, it's more likely to happen when you're not consciously able to control it, like when you're sleeping. Sleeping on your side or stomach can create an easy escape route from your mouth. Sleeping on your back may help curb drooling.<h2>Does sleep apnea cause drooling?</h2>Drooling. Those who wake up from sleep to find a pool of saliva on their pillow are seeing the evidence that they breathe through the mouth at night. This is a natural reaction of the nervous system when the airway is blocked.<h2>What are the warning signs of sleep apnea?</h2><p>Signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea include:</p><ul><li>Excessive daytime sleepiness.</li><li>Loud snoring.</li><li>Observed episodes of stopped breathing during sleep.</li><li>Abrupt awakenings accompanied by gasping or choking.</li><li>Awakening with a dry mouth or sore throat.</li><li>Morning headache.</li><li>Difficulty concentrating during the day.</li></ul><h2>How do you treat drooling?</h2>Traditional treatment options include daily oral medications to diminish saliva production, periodic injections of a medication called Botox for temporary reduction in saliva production, or a variety of open surgical procedures to remove some salivary glands or disconnect others from the mouth.<h2>Can you choke on saliva while sleeping?</h2>Thick mucus or saliva triggered by allergies or respiratory problems may not easily flow down your throat.

Causes of postnasal drip include infections, allergies, and acid reflux. As well as feeling the need to clear the throat frequently, a person with postnasal drip may also experience: a sore throat.<h2>Why do I always have boogers in my nose?</h2>This can happen from colds, allergies, the flu, or other irritants.
