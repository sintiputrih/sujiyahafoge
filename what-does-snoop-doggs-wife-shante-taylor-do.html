Though the rapper has made the rounds when it comes to romance, at the end of the day, Shante won his heart.She met her now-husband in high school when he was known as Cordozar Calvin Broadus Jr. and away from the limelight. She remained by his side through thick and thin, eventually becoming his first manager. For decades, Snoop has been entertaining the world, but less is known about his wife. So, who is Shaun Taylor Broadus and what does she do?<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>An Inside Look At Snoop Dogg’s Mansion</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-shante-broadus-amp-what-does-her-married-life-look-like>Who Is Shante Broadus & What Does Her Married Life Look Like?</h2><p>Shante Broadus was born in California in 1971. She went to Long Beach Polytechnic High School where she met Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. – the guy that soon became Snoop Dogg. They fell in love and were then married in 1997 and have a family together. Despite nearly divorcing, the pair has renewed their vows and persevered through the difficult times.</p><p><a href=#>Snoop filed for divorce from Shante</a> in 2004 for “irreconcilable differences,” but he didn’t go through with it in the end. The rapper admitted that he <a href=#>went back home and “fell back in love” with his wife and their children</a>. The couple also credited their marriage lasting because of their daughter Cori’s diagnosis with Lupus.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, that came after their 'break' <a href=#>when Snoop Dogg left his wife for a time, and was aiming to follow a different career path</a> from the one he's on today.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Snoop Dogg And His Wife Shante Broadus Set Serious Marriage Goals</a></span></p><p>Despite the issues in the past, Shante and Snoop are still going strong. The rapper may be the most unlikely source for this level of stability and devotion but believe it or not, he and his wife have a marriage that is comparable to the bond that people have seen between Justin Bieber and wife Hailey...with one major difference. This marriage has withstood the test of time!</p><p>Currently, the pair each has their own impressive careers, and they both excel at what they choose to do. Since everyone knows Snoop as a household name in the music industry, what does his wife Shante actually do for a living?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-shante-taylor-broadus-do>What Does Shante Taylor Broadus Do?</h2><p>Shante Broadus has an impressive resume that includes making wonderful things happen for bright people. She officially became Snoop Dogg's manager in 2021, which is a significant task considering the musician's involvement in TV, apparel, cannabis, video games, mobile apps, and a lot more.</p><p>Still, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being her husband’s manager</a> is clearly a role she’s been preparing for since the ’90s. “Shante has been guiding my career behind the scenes from day one. She has always been my final gut check with all my decisions, and I wouldn’t be where I am today without her. I am grateful to have her as my official manager, helping to build the Snoop Dogg empire together,” Snoop said in a press release cited by Forbes.</p><p>Shante also couldn’t be happier with the role, she told in an interview: “He knows that he can always trust me. So he wanted the world to know he had his wife by his side, helping him. He wanted a strong female to lead. And of course, that’s me. I’m the boss lady.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from being Snoop’s manager, Shante is also the founder of Boss Lady Entertainment. As the name implies, the company is a powerhouse that, among other endeavors, helms operation for a Los Angeles recording and events complex called The Compound that draws such top-notch talent like Cardi B and Kendrick Lamar.</p><p>Shante was also executive producer on the 2012 Snoop documentary titled, Reincarnated, was part of the E! reality show, Snoop Dogg’s Fatherhood. Moreover, she has a number of brands under her belt and has a new venture called The Broadus Collection – a collection of scented candles. To add to the list of her achievements, she’s also the CEO of Boss Lady Spirits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shante Broadus, who has a net worth of $5 million, is proof that it’s not where you came from that matters — it’s where you’re going, and what you do with what you’ve been given. She’s been through a lot — personally and professionally — yet persevered to make a name for herself, by herself.</p><p>Most of all, she’s more than just Snoop Dogg’s wife — she’s a mother, grandmother, and consummate professional, and that alone makes her story both aspirational and inspirational. And that makes people love her!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>When Did Snoop Dogg Change His Name (And Who Is Snoop Lion)</a></span></p><h2 id=what-do-fans-think-of-snoop-dogg-rsquo-s-wife-shante>What Do Fans Think Of Snoop Dogg’s Wife, Shante?</h2><p>Snoop and Shante have reportedly grown closer, owing to the fact that they were together prior to his money rise. There was a period in Snoop's life when he didn't have the fame and income he has now, and many fans believe that the reason his marriage has lasted is that it was founded on love rather than money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans have commented by saying; "Only a boss lady who loved you before money and fame can be trusted." and "you two age like fine wine."
