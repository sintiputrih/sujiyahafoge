That was enough to make him one of the world’s top 20 highest-paid rappers.</p><p>Amazon and Puma are two of his sponsors.</p><p>He earned $20 million between September 2018 and September 2019.</p><table class="has-subtle-pale-blue-background-color has-background"><tr><th class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Year</th><th class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Net Worth $</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>2016</td><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>$12.8 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>2017</td><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>$13 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>2018</td><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>$14 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>2019</td><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>$15 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>2020</td><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>$20 Million</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Income</h3><p>Meek Mill’s annual salary is reported to be $1.34 million. As a result, his fans frequently inquire, “How much does Meek Mill make?”</p><p>Meek Mill’s YouTube channel receives approximately 22.31 million monthly views and 743.71 thousand daily views.</p><p>For every thousand video views, a channel that is monetized by adverts gets the money.</p><p>Per thousand video views, YouTube channels can earn anything from $3 to $7.</p><p>Therefore, based on this information, we estimate that the Meek Mill YouTube channel produces $89.25 thousand in ad revenue per month and $1.34 million per year.</p><p>However, $1.34 million a year could be an underestimate. Advertising revenue might reach $2.41 million per year if Meek Mill’s earnings are on the upper end.</p><p>Meek Mill’s studio albums have almost all been commercially successful. Mills, on the other hand, generates money from concert tours in addition to album sales.</p><p>He has headlined two tours, Dreamchasers Tour in 2012 and Motivation Tour in 2019, and a co-headlining tour with Future called Legendary Nights Tour in 2019.</p><p>Meek Mill’s primary source of revenue in the music industry is record production.</p><p>The rapper announced his record label, Dream Chasers Records, on October 26, 2012.</p><p>Lee Mazin, Goldie, and Louie V Gutta were among the label’s most well-known performers.</p><p>On July 24, 2019, Dream Chasers Records, a joint venture with Jay-Z’s Roc Nation, was announced. Mill was named the label’s president.</p><p>His responsibilities included directing operations at the company’s New York headquarters and managing a recording studio for label artists.</p><h2>Meek Mill: Net Worth in Different Currencies</h2><p>Let’s look at the Net Worth of Meek Mill in several currencies, including BitCoin, the cryptocurrency.</p><table class=mytable width=696><tbody><tr><td><strong>Currency</strong></td><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Euro</td><td>€ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":17046500}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14851,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"12":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDEUR")*R[-1]C[-1]'>17,046,500</span></td></tr><tr><td>Pound Sterling</td><td>£ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":14643000}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14851,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"12":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDGBP")*R[-2]C[-1]'>14,643,000</span></td></tr><tr><td>Australian Dollar</td><td>A$ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":27601999.999999996}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDAUD")*R[-3]C[-1]'>27,602,000</span></td></tr><tr><td>Canadian Dollar</td><td>C$ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":25661000}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDCAD")*R[-4]C[-1]'>25,661,000</span></td></tr><tr><td>Indian Rupee</td><td>₹ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":1473604000}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDINR")*R[-5]C[-1]'>1,473,604,000</span></td></tr><tr><td>BitCoin</td><td>฿ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":456.44759999999997}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDBTC")*R[-6]C[-1]'>456</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Meek Mill: House and Cars</h2><h3>House</h3><p>Meek and Nicki Minaj rented a Beverly Hills property for $35,000 per month in 2016.</p><p>The house was built in 2008 on the former home of Frank Sinatra.</p><p>The residence has 10,340 square feet and offers magnificent views of the city and mountains.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/meek-mill-house.jpg><p>A two-story foyer, a huge living room with a fireplace, and arched French doors going outside characterize the home.</p><p>There are eight bedrooms, an eat-in kitchen, a wood-lined library with built-ins, a formal dining room, and a family room.</p><p>A swimming pool and spa, as well as a BBQ, are available in the outdoor area.</p><p>So he was preparing to move in with Nicki Minaj in a magnificent Beverly Hills mansion last year, and he was willing to pay $30,000 per month for it.</p><p>We don’t know what happened with those intentions since they recently broke up and because Minaj’s name is on the lease after Meek’s legal troubles.</p><h3>Cars</h3><p>However, his long years of longing and hard work paid handsomely when it came to cars. As a result, Meek has amassed quite an automobile collection.</p><p>His current vehicles include the Maybach, Bentley Mulsanne, Aston Martin Rapide with gold wheels, Rolls Royce Ghost, Mercedes S-Class, Bentley Flying Spurs, and Mercedes G63.</p><p>And he’d only just begun. Consider his automobile collection ten years from now.</p><h4>Aston Martin Rapide</h4><p>The Rapide debuted in 2010, and it marked Aston Martin’s entry into the very competitive four-door luxury sedan market, which was already packed with capable German products.</p><p>Those three initials (Aston Martin Racing) turn the sedan into a fire-breathing supercar due to one of the last all-motor V12 engine configurations available.</p><p>The Rapide AMR’s 595-horsepower engine propels it to a top speed of 205 mph, and an upgraded suspension system ensures it can grip even more complex.</p><p>The Rapide AMR will be produced in small numbers; only 210 of these exceptional sedans will be created worldwide, with a price tag of $240,000, competing with the Porsche Panamera Turbo.</p><h4>Bentley Flying Spurs</h4><p>The new Flying Spur is an excellent example of an imposing car that manages to be appealing simultaneously.</p><p>The massive slatted grille warns slowpokes that something big and wrong is approaching behind, but the LED headlights will suffice if they don’t notice.</p><p>The V8 model has a black gloss matrix grille with chrome surrounds and brilliant Bentley wing emblems, while the W12 model has bright vertical vanes, a black matrix-style grille, and black ‘B’ badging.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/meek-mill-car.jpg><p>The W12’s arches are filled with 21-inch ten-spoke alloys, while the V8’s are 20-inch ten-spoke alloys.</p><p>In addition, the W12 features two big oval exhaust pipes at the back, whereas the V8 has quad pipes.</p><h4>Mercedes G63</h4><p>The 2021 Mercedes-AMG G63 is all about making things look easy, whether it’s tearing down the autobahn at triple-digit speeds or crawling over boulders in Moab at single-digit rates.</p><p>Under its squared-off hood, this modernized version of the legendary original G-class features all of AMG’s go-fast bits and baubles, including a 577-hp twin-turbo V-8 engine.</p><p>Inside, you’ll find a slew of modern infotainment and tech options at your fingertips, and your backside will be propped up on a leather-wrapped throne with just enough bolstering to keep you upright for any of the G63’s off-road adventures.</p><p>It costs a lot of money to live so comfortably, but the G63 is well worth it if you can afford it.</p><h2>Meek Mill: Lifestyle and Vacation</h2><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>Meek Mill is sick of the American way of life and plans to leave the country and return to his homeland.</p><p>Meek mentioned that he is interested in purchasing real estate in Africa, notably Ghana.</p><p>Ghana is becoming a popular tourist destination for African-Americans in the United States.</p><p>The administration welcomed Blacks from the United States wishing to flee the country’s racial strife in July.</p><p>The government even collaborated with local chiefs to set aside 500 acres of property to house approximately 1,500 new households. Meek Mill might very well be one of them.</p><p>“I want to buy a house in Ghana, but where do I begin? A lovely home. Meek Mill added, “I need to feel that experience with my family as another choice in life.” “I don’t want to devote my entire life to the American way of life I’ve been experiencing… the odds seem to be stacked against us!”</p><p>Ghana’s government introduced “The Year of the Return” in 2019 to commemorate 400 years since the first enslaved African arrived in Jamestown, Virginia.</p><p>Because of its coastal location, Ghana hosted over 75% of the slave dungeons, many of which still exist today, before Africans were sent off to the “New World” and enslaved.</p><p>A-listers like Beyonce, Cardi B., Jay-Z, Ludacris, T.I., and Samuel L. Jackson attended the campaign, which resulted in a 45 percent boost in tourists — thanks to African-Americans looking to reconnect with their roots.</p><h4>Jewelry and Watches</h4><p>For a man with a net worth of millions of dollars, it’s unsurprising that Meek Mill spends his hard-earned money on luxury timepieces.</p><p>I mean, a guy has to gaze over his gold-encrusted wrist, right?</p><p>It’s because the singer views them as a long-term investment rather than a frivolous purchase.</p><p>Anyway, here are some of the rapper’s timepieces: Meek and his Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Chronograph, which costs $62,000.</p><p>The rapper also has two Rolex watches in addition to his Audemars Piguet.</p><p>His $68K watch, a custom-made Presidential Rolex with 23 carats of white diamonds, is shown above. His other Rolex was given to him by another rapper, Jay-Z.</p><p>They’ve been good friends for a long time and have been vocal advocates of one another.</p><p>So what’s the backstory to the gift?&nbsp; His billionaire pal sent a Daytona Rolex as an invitation to the Shawn Carter Foundation Gala.</p><p>That’s a great way to invite a buddy! We’ll now move on to the rapper’s well-known jewelry.</p><p>Meek Mill, like other hip-hop musicians, enjoys wearing bling. And the one above stands out since it’s a chain necklace with pendants of late rappers.</p><p>He released a photo of the custom-made diamond chain to the world in 2019.</p><p>The piece of jewelry also features photographs of his late pals Snupe and Nipsey, who were both slain when they were little.</p><p>It seemed to me to be a luxurious method of honoring a friend – albeit a huge one. But I can’t say I blame him.</p><h3>Vacation</h3><p>Meek Mill was honored with getting his holiday in his birthplace of Philadelphia.</p><p>In honor of the Championships rapper, City Council President Darrell L. Clarke declared Thursday, March 14, 2019, the start of “Meek Mill Weekend.”</p><p>In addition to the proclamation at the city level, Pennsylvania State Senator Sharif Street made a statewide announcement. From Thursday to Saturday, “Meek Mill Weekend” will take place.</p><p>Meek Mill’s decision to give him his weekend in Philadelphia came less than three weeks after Houston gave him his day on February 24.</p><p>Meek shared a snapshot of himself exploring the city while clutching a proclamation plaque.</p><p>According to TMZ, the award was most likely presented in recognition of his work advocating for criminal justice reform.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/meek-mill-vacation.jpg><p>Moreover, Meek Mill, a rapper and proponent of criminal justice reform, and fashion designer Milan Harris were photographed in Jamaica on holiday.</p><p>According to Hollywood and bet.com, they were also on a “babymoon,” which is like a last vacation before the baby arrived.</p><p>While there are no photos of them together in Jamaica, they have shared photos of similar places on Instagram.</p><p>Finally, we’re pleased to see Meek and Milan having the time of their lives before welcoming their baby.</p><p><strong>You might also be interested in <a href=# rel=noopener>Mel Gibsons’s Net Worth: Career & Charity</a>.</strong></p><h2>Meek Mill: Music, Activism, Dream Chasers Records, Endorsement</h2><h3>Music</h3><p>Meek Mill’s primary source of wealth was his desire to become a successful rapper. Young Jeezy, Clipse, Trick Daddy, <a href=# rel=noopener>Jay Z</a>, Juelz Santana, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Lil Wayne</a> are just a few rappers who have impacted him.</p><p>Mill resumed pursuing a solo music career after The Bloodhoundz split up, using the same identity as before.</p><p>The mixtapes “The Real Me” and “The Real Me 2,” both released in late 2006, were his debut studio projects.</p><p>Meek Mill’s fortune arose due to the rapper’s release of a few more mixtapes, which led to him being given many recording deals.</p><p>He released four mixtapes between 2008 and 2010, titled “Flamers,” “Flamers 2,” “Flamers 2,5”, and “Flamers 3,” all of which were commercially successful.</p><p>After the release of his first mixtape in 2009, he grabbed the notice of T.I., a well-known artist and producer who decided to sign him to his Grand Hustle label.</p><p>The rapper’s contract with Grand Hustle provided him with a plethora of chances, and he became not only wealthy but also famous as a result of it.</p><h3>Activism</h3><p>After his release from state custody in 2018, Mill instantly became a leading champion for criminal justice reform in the United States.
