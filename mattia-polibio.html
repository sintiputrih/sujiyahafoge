In November 2019, a collection of his private photos were widely shared online.</p><p>In one of these photos, he appears nude while hiding his private parts behind a cereal box. The notorious prank website channel45news had started at least two widely-circulated rumors about him.</p><p>In one article, they falsely reported that authorities apprehended him for fighting. Its author, a fellow TikTok user named Mel Morales, never tried to hide that it was a prank article.</p><p>Instead, she used the attention it garnered to promote her own TikTok page, hence damaging Mattia’s public image.</p><p>Similarly, on 17 December 2019, Channel 45 News again featured the fake news of Mattia Polibio’s death in a vehicular accident. It was also a false report for another prank article.</p><p>Many of his fans and fellow social media stars believed it until they said that the news was a hoax. Mattia has not since put out any statement on the matter.</p><p>Additionally, during a TikTok stream with Alejandro Rosario, Mattia said the “N-word,” reportedly while imitating former TikTok user AcidPrincessx3, who had said the word at least on two different instances.</p><p>However, he later issued an apology. Viewers have also accused Mattia of using homophobic and other racial slurs several times.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Status>Relationship Status</span></h2><p>At present, Mattia seems to be single. He has not shared any social media posts that might indicate his current relationships or affairs.</p><p>Similarly, he might also be more focused on strengthening his professional life.</p><p>However, for a brief period, he dated a girl named Jenna Hablitz. Following their split, he created a live stream in which he related to his fans that he was feeling heartbroken and dubbed his former girlfriend “manipulative.”</p><p>This led to his followers going to the girl’s Instagram page and leaving spiteful comments on her posts. She was ultimately forced to turn off comments.</p><p>Then at some point, the pair reconciled, and Mattia condemned the behavior of his fans, stating that he had never insinuated that she had been unfaithful to him.</p><p>Eventually, they parted ways once more, and Polibio told his fans during another livestream that he was not prepared to be in a relationship and required time to concentrate on himself.</p><h2><span id=Mattia_Polibio_8211_Net_Worth_2024>Mattia Polibio – Net Worth 2024</span></h2><p>Moving on, his <strong>net worth</strong> estimation is around $250,000.
