Kempson used the defence the pair were engaged in “rough sex”.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Gillian said the trial was horrendous, having to just sit in a courtroom and listen “while they’re annihilating your daughter”.</p><p>She said the family has never mentioned Kempson’s name.</p><p>“I don’t think about him, I don’t care what happens to him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/1XwWZbvnx9dX7vi6DjYKoqdM120=/16x19/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/UJ7XZ36HMUAKIJNYJ75XP75KRQ.jpg"><p>“He came into our life and destroyed our family. I don’t care about his name, I don’t care about him,” she said.</p><p>Just a week before Grace was killed, Gillian underwent surgery for a breast cancer diagnosis.</p><p>In a double blow for the family, Grace’s father David Millane was diagnosed with cancer after spending almost three weeks in Auckland in December 2019 while attending the trial for his daughter’s killer.</p><p>“He was taken unwell while we were at the trial but we just put it down to stress and we thought he had an ulcer,” Gillian said.</p><p>Unfortunately, David was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/fT4hXn4_395Got8Fp71tklex_A8=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/YTRQS4KGEBFEXGWHGKI6RXOH74.jpg"><p>“That was another disastrous Christmas and New Year,” said Gillian.</p><p>After the cancer spread to his brain, <a href=#>David died in November 2020</a>.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“I was in such a dark, lonely place and I pushed everybody away... Trying to find your path on this road of grief is a very difficult thing to do.</p><p>“You get to a point when you realise that you’re the only one that can get you out of there,” Gillian said.</p><p>Through numerous amounts of grief counselling and victim support, Gillian says she found a chink of light, channelling her grief into Grace’s memory.</p><p>She now is heavily involved in advocating for justice, “raising awareness about the importance of respecting and protecting the rights and safety of individuals”.</p><p>Gillian works closely with White Ribbon, which aims to flip the script of “boys will be boys”.</p><p>“I can say that my toes are always in the darkness and sometimes my feet and waist but my head is probably more in the sun now,” she said.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>In October 2020, Kempson was also convicted on eight charges relating to offending against his former partner including sexual violation by unlawful sexual connection, threatening to kill, assault with a weapon and male assaults female.</p><p>In November 2020, he was convicted on one charge of sexually violating another woman, a British tourist like Millane, in an unrelated incident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/pLlEAfBeKYXjhBpYyrPlYHaNVqE=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/DYJLSRR3WJH2RMWQ3M6732SRBA.jpg"><p>“You have no reason to convict me,” Kempson yelled at trial judge Justice Geoffrey Venning from the dock at the <a href=#>conclusion of his third</a> trial.</p><p>“I can’t wait for the Court of Appeal to overturn you, mate. You’re full of s***.”</p><p>For both sets of the offending, he received total sentence of 11 years’ imprisonment. This was ordered to be served concurrently with the life sentence he received for murdering Millane, whose body was found in a shallow grave in the Waitākere bush.</p><p>The now 31-year-old Kempson <a href=#>appealed both his convictions and his sentences</a> for the offending against the two other women and a Court of Appeal hearing was held last year.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/YNazqIrByE6r_22s_qTPtfVVT14=/16x9/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/4FOGV757W4CIAUNXSXAI7FVZSY.jpg"><p>In March this year, <a href=#>the judgment, with reasons by Justice David Gendall, was released</a>.</p><p>He said after reviewing all of the submissions made by Kempson’s legal team and the Crown, the appeal was rejected.</p><p>“We find that neither of the individual sentences imposed contained any error, nor is the total cumulative sentence of 11 years’ imprisonment manifestly excessive,” Justice Gendall ruled.</p><p>“Both appeals against sentence are also dismissed.”</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmp7JfnLatuMiapWalmaG5orrEZqSorJiav267xWaZq6GknsCpecGamqSokZi4pr6MoKmam5Viuqq4y5qlnmWdqr%2BlsdGem2ahnmK7psOMs5yapJGjsW6u0Z6YpKtdnbKzedKio56mk5p6sMLEq2SdmaWctbWx0axknZ2RqbVwpap%2FjoVtd4Sdl46ogX%2BBa3%2BKpJqlpXCDbX1f</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./luke-hemmings-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-91302-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Luke Hemmings Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
