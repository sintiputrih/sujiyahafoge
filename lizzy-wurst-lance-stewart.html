Wurst is in a relationship and enjoying the love life.</p><h2>Age and Parents</h2><p>Lizzy Wurst was born on 22nd July 1998 in New Jersey. The name of her parents is <strong>Tom Wurst</strong> and <strong>Maria Wurst</strong>. Added to that, she has a brother named <strong>Jack Wurst</strong>. She is pretty close to all of them.</p><p>Wurst is 22 years old as of now. She holds the American nationality along with the white ethnicity. Her zodiac sign falls under Leo, suggesting the fact that she is caring and generous.</p><h2>Body Measurements: Height and Weight</h2><p>Lizzy Wurst has just stepped into her 20s, and her beauty and charm look outstanding in front of the camera. This gorgeous lady stands at a decent height of 5’1″ and weighs 52 kgs.</p><p>As being a social media personality, keeping a fit body is the need of the hour. So, Wurst has left no stones unturned to look slim and fit. The regular gym work has helped her for sure.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Weller Age, Net Worth, YouTube, Songs, Boxing, Girlfriend, Instagram >></a></p><p>Moreover, the vital body statistics of the social media star stand at 35-25-35 inches. The most distinctive feature of Wurst is the body figure for sure.</p><p>The shoe size of Lizzy stands at the count of 6. Added to that, blonde hair and blue eyes play a lead role in her beauty.</p><h2>Early Days and Education</h2><p>Lizzy was born in New Jersey and spent her childhood there with her family and siblings. The early days were pretty decent, with all of her needs being fulfilled with ease. From a very young age, Wurst was highly motivated to be part of the entertainment world.</p><p>In the case of educational background, though, she was part of Delsea High School in her hometown. Other than the schooling institute, there is no information about higher studies.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Like most of Lizzy, fans would know her career began on Vine, where she posted videos to collect followers. Her popularity increased with time when Vine was shut down.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wurst-668.jpg><p>Then, another fellow Vine artist insisted she join Youtube, and her career changed after it. She posted vlog videos that tend to earn huge fans for her on Youtube.</p><p>Most of the time, she was seen doing collaborations with other YouTubers and making exciting videos too. Not only vlog but she was seen doing challenge videos.</p><p>One with the headline Pepper challenge received rave reviews. The horizon of her skills kept on increasing when she added pranks and funny videos to her channel.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Veronica Wang Age, Parents, Surgery, Noodles, YouTuber, Pregnancy, Instagram >></a></p><p>As her popularity among the fans on Youtube is soaring high, many brands have come to her for endorsements and sponsored posts. This suggests the fact that Lizzy is not to be overlooked as a Youtube star.</p><p>Jumping from one social media to another is the basic idea of Wurst, who is equally famous on Instagram. On her Instagram account, the diva posts short videos that are highly liked by the audience.</p><p>Looking at her beauty, skills, and charm, we feel the showbiz world is the ultimate destination for Lizzy. If any new step towards it is seen from her, readers will be made aware.</p><h2>Controversy</h2><p>If you are a public figure, controversy is always part of your meal. Lizzy has also been part of it for some instances.</p><p>Once, she was finger-pointed out that her videos are more of a clickbait than originally in it. Fans pointed to the fact that the title is one way while the actual video is way different.</p><p>Another controversy stated by the channel of Lance Stewart clearly stated the fact that Wurst and her mother had an ugly fight. Lizzy’s mother started a Youtube channel that needed promotion.</p><p>She approached her daughter, but she rejected, and ultimately Wurst was thrown out of her house. All of this created a pretty big mess.</p><h2>Lizzy Wurst: Suicide Attempts&nbsp;</h2><p>She revealed that at one point in her life, she was so down and depressed that she tried to take her own life. Likewise, she felt sad and worthless that she didn’t know what to do with her life or why she wanted to live any longer.</p><p>She said –</p><p>” I felt like trying to take my own life was literally the last resort. It was a very, very deep hole that I got myself into, and I DIDN’T know how to get out of it, and I thought that was the only way”</p><p>On January 3, 2019, she attempted suicide; however, she regretted it instantly and called 911 and an ambulance, and was hospitalized for a week. She went on to say how grateful she is that it didn’t happen, as well as to the people that were there for her.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who Is Lizzy Wurst’s Boyfriend?</h2><p>It is a well-known fact that the fame of Lizzy is highly due to her ex-boyfriend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lance Stewart</a>. It was Stewart who inspired her to try out Youtube, and her life changed.</p><p>Both of them knew each other way back in 2012 when they were Vine users. This bonding turned out to be pretty good even after Vine shut down. Both of them dated for over five years and appeared in lots of videos together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wurst-667.jpg><p>Sadly in December 2018, Lizzy announced that they were separating. This broke the heart of lots of Lizzy and Lance’s fans. Even after going on their separate ways, they are pretty good friends.</p><p>All of this suggests the fact that Lizzy is single at this point. She is more focused on her career rather than finding a perfect match. Even though she has been in a relationship, the charming lady is neither married nor engaged up until this point.</p><h2>Lizzy Wurst Net Worth: Income and Salary</h2><p>Social media is a pretty fruitful field of work if you know how to use it. Lizzy is a prime example of the fact that Youtube can make an individual globally famous. As of 2020, Lizzy owns a net worth of <strong>$300k.</strong></p><p>All of this is the outcome of Youtube, sponsored promotions, and many more. Wurst, in her free time, loves to go traveling and also dance to her favorite songs.</p><p>She moved into the new apartment in 2019 with her friend Kelly after ending everything with her ex-boyfriend. She also posted a vlog about her new beginning in life and an apartment tour on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Youtube</a>. Furthermore, she has a greyish Kia Stinger car.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview, this social media star stated that she loved pets and has a dog named Theo. Moreover, watching the movies of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jim Carrey</a> and Adam Sandler are her favorite things to do.</p><p>Although there is proper information on the net worth, annual income and assets are a far cry. Whatever it might be, Wurst surely is living a great life.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nate Garner Age, Height, Net Worth, YouTuber, Model, Fiance, IG >></a></p><h2>Internet Fame</h2><p>Vine, Instagram, and Youtube made Lizzy the person that she is today.
