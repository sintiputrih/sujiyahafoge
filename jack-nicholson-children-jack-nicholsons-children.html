He also received the American Film Institute’s Life Achievement Award in 1994 and the Kennedy Center Honor in 2001.</p><p>One of Jack Nicholson’s most notable accomplishments is his three Academy Awards, which he won for Best Actor in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975) and As Good as It Gets (1997), and Best Supporting Actor in Terms of Endearment (1983).</p><p>He was also nominated for an Oscar for his roles in Easy Rider (1969), Five Easy Pieces (1970), The Last Detail (1974), Chinatown (1974), Reds (1981), Prizzi’s Honor (1986), Ironweed (1987), A Few Good Men (1992), and About Schmidt (2002). Nicholson is also known for his outstanding performances in Carnal Knowledge (1971), The Shining (1980), Heartburn (1986), Broadcast News (1987), Batman (1989), Hoffa (1992), Mars Attacks! (1996), Something’s Gotta Give (2003), The Departed (2006), and The Bucket List (2007).</p><p>In addition to his acting career, Jack Nicholson has also directed three films: Drive, He Said (1971), Goin’ South (1978), and The Two Jakes (1990). He is one of only three male actors to win three Academy Awards, and one of only two actors to be nominated for an Academy Award for acting in films made in every decade from the 1960s to the 2000s. His 12 Academy Award nominations make Nicholson the most nominated male actor in the Academy’s history.</p><p>Before his acting career took off, Jack Nicholson joined the California Air National Guard in 1957 to avoid being drafted into the military. During his time in the Guard, he completed basic training at Lackland Air Force Base and served as a firefighter, performing weekend drills and two-week annual training at the Van Nuys Airport unit. He was called up for several months of extended active duty during the Berlin Crisis of 1961 and was discharged at the end of his enlistment in 1962.</p><p>Despite his remarkable achievements, Jack Nicholson has had some controversial moments in his personal life. In 1994, he was charged with assault and vandalism after using a golf club to damage the roof and windshield of a car belonging to a man who he accused of cutting him off in traffic. The charges were later dropped after Nicholson apologized to the man and reached an undisclosed settlement, which included a reported $500,000 check from Nicholson.</p><p>In 1996, Nicholson was sued by a woman named Catherine Sheehan, who alleged that he had promised her $1,000 for sex and then assaulted her when she asked for the money. Sheehan received a settlement of about $40,000 but filed another lawsuit against Nicholson, arguing that the settlement was insufficient to cover the injuries inflicted upon her, including brain trauma. The case was dismissed.</p><p>Despite these controversies, Nicholson’s contributions to the film industry are undeniable. He has been recognized as a true master of his craft and continues to be an inspiration to actors and filmmakers around the world.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jack Nicholson Children: Meet Jack Nicholson’s 6 Children</h2><p>Jack Nicholson has fathered six (6) children, and here is the complete list of Jack Nicholson’s children:</p><li>Jennifer Nicholson (born September 13, 1963), his daughter with ex-wife Sandra Knight.</li><li>Caleb Goddard (born September 26, 1970), whose legal father is Mark Goddard, but who is believed by some to be Nicholson’s biological son.</li><li>Honey Hollman (born January 26, 1982), whose mother is Danish model Winnie Hollman, but whose paternity Nicholson has never publicly acknowledged.</li><li>Lorraine Nicholson (born April 16, 1990), and</li><li>Raymond Nicholson (born February 20, 1992), his children with actress Rebecca Broussard.</li><li>Tessa Gourin (born August 15, 1994), whose mother is waitress Jeannine Gourin, but whose paternity Nicholson has never publicly acknowledged.</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqOYnKNdo7aktM6lqqimXZi1qrjDq5ynZZqWsKx5zaKaoaecqLyvv4ycn6KklKeyr3s%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kellen-moore-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kellen Moore | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career">&larr;
