The YouTuber often gets attention... but not for positive reasons. However, when <a href=#>Paul started dating model Nina Agdal</a> in 2022, people began focusing on his love life instead of his scandals. The couple has each had relationships with famous people before. Paul previously dated actress Chloe Bennet and Agdal has had romances with Leonardo DiCaprio and Adam Levine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Logan Paul has made a lot of money since he became a YouTube star in 2013. But has his girlfriend Nina Agdal done well as a model? What is her net worth like compared to her controversial boyfriend's?</p><h2 id=what-is-nina-agdal-39-s-net-worth-and-how-does-it-compare-to-logan-paul-39-s>What Is Nina Agdal's Net Worth And How Does It Compare To Logan Paul's?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nina Agdal has a net worth of $12 million</a>, according to Celebrity Net Worth. The publication notes that she appeared in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 2012, which is definitely a big deal for a model beginning their career.</p><p>Nina Agdal posed for the Swimsuit Issue six times. According to Swimsuit.si.com, she really appreciates the opportunity. Agdal told the website when she celebrated her 31st birthday in March 2023, “Sports Illustrated Swimsuit and MJ Day [editor in chief] were the ones to put my name on the map and that helped me pursue my modeling career in a way that wouldn’t have been possible without them. Some of my best memories are from the early, early mornings and shoot days with the SI crew.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nina-agdal.jpg><p>Although people are used to hearing about supermodels and their high salaries, it can take a while to build up to that level. According to Backstage.com, a model who works an eight-hour day will be paid $1,000. And if someone works for four hours, they will make $500.</p><p>Models who work runway shows will be paid more. Gabriela Pierantoni, who runs a business called Corestone Models, told Backstage.com that supermodels can be paid $20,000 for each fashion show. Rodney Harris, who runs Slamm Management, said that payment for other types of models could be between $200 and $1,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Adgal began modeling professionally in 2012, she has been working steadily for just over a decade. It looks like she made a good amount of money in a fairly short amount of time.</p><p>While $12 million is an absolutely huge amount of money, it doesn't even come close to the money that Logan Paul has made. Celebrity Net Worth puts his net worth at $45 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Where Did Logan Paul Buy His $5.2 Million Pokémon Card?</a></span></p><p>Paul not only has a successful YouTube channel but sells clothing through Maverick Apparel. He has also acted in movies like Valley Girl, which was released in 2020. And he is also a wrestler.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nina-agdal-logan-paul.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since <a href=#>Logan Paul buys so many expensive things</a>, it makes sense that he has such a high net worth. Celebrity Net Worth reported that he earned between $12 and $14 million in 2016, 2017, and 2018, which is pretty wild to think about.</p><h2 id=what-is-nina-agdal-39-s-life-as-a-model-like>What Is Nina Agdal's Life As A Model Like?</h2><p>Nina Agdal definitely appears to like being a model, and she seems to have had some incredible experiences in the industry. However, she has also had some tough times, and she has been honest about them.</p><p>In January 2018, Agdal posted on her Instagram account and explained that she had booked a job with a company that treated her incredibly poorly. She said that after the shoot was over, her agent got an e-mail saying that she wasn't the same weight that she was supposed to be based on her samples. The company said that they wouldn't be using the photos.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Floyd Mayweather Earned Way More Than Logan Paul For Their Controversial PPV Fight</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adgal wrote, "the publisher claimed my look deviated from my portfolio and that I did not fit into the (sample size) samples, which is completely false." She continued, "So, shame on you and thank you to the publisher for reaffirming how important it is to live your truth and say it out loud, no matter who you are or what size."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nina-agdal-black-outfit.jpg><p>After that point, the model decided to focus on jobs that made her happy, which was a smart move. In a February 2023 interview with W Magazine, she said, “I’m being very selective with what I’m doing right now because this is very important to me. I’m not trying to jump into whatever job jumps up."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Timeline Of Jake And Logan Paul's Boxing Career</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adgal told W Magazine that she was still going to be a model but wanted to be a positive force in the industry. She said, "it is just going to be a different direction where I can speak my own story, too, and not just be a face.”</p><p>Her words are likely very inspiring for anyone who has experienced similar body shaming in the modeling or acting industries. It's cool that she wanted to talk about what she experienced. Hopefully, since her Instagram post got so much attention, she has encouraged people to be more body positive.</p><h2 id=what-has-nina-agdal-said-about-her-relationship-with-logan-paul>What Has Nina Agdal Said About Her Relationship With Logan Paul?</h2><p>On December 31st, 2022, Nina Agdal posted a photo on Instagram of her and Logan Paul and said "2022, the beginning of me and you." And she has been pretty vocal about how much she cares about him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/logan-paul.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In February 2023, Agdal was interviewed by Fashion Week Daily. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Agdal talked about Logan Paul</a> among other topics like her strong work ethic and what she eats on a regular basis. She shared a lot, including that she was in the middle of a pickleball game when she injured her back. And she talked about the night when she and Paul first saw each other.</p><p>When told that she seems glad to be in a relationship with Paul, the model agreed. Agdal said, "Awww, I am! We met at an event in NYC. I found out he was there and my gut was screaming that I had to say hi to him. I basically convinced him to meet me and my friends upstairs for a drink. I didn’t want to walk downstairs because of my bad back."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/logan-paul-and-nina-agdal.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Agdal continued to Fashion Week Daily, "He came upstairs and we started joking around.
