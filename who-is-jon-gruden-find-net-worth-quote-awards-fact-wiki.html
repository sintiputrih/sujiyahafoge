He is widely known as an American Football coach and a former football player. Jon has worked with such teams as the “Oakland Raiders”, “Tampa Bay Buccaneers” among others. In addition to his, Gruden has also worked on several television projects. One of Gruden’s most significant achievements during his career as a coach was wining the “Super Bowl XXXVII” with the Buccaneers in 2002. His talent and experience allowed him to become one of the most respected coaches in the sports world. On the other hand, Jon now does not work as a coach and has other activities to take care of.</p><p>If you consider how rich Jon Gruden is, it can be said that Jon’s estimated net worth is $22.5 million. The main source of this sum of money is, of course, his career as a football coach. In addition to this, Gruden has worked with other teams not only as their coach but sometimes as an administrator or coordinator. Recently, Jon’s net worth has been growing because of his work in the television industry.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=jon-gruden-net-worth-225-million></span>Jon Gruden Net Worth $22.5 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>When Jon was still very young he spent a lot of time playing football and learning more about this game as his father and brother were both related to this sport. When Jon finished Clay High School he decided to continue his studies at the University of Dayton, where he played for its football team. In 1985 Jon graduated with a degree in communications, and soon secured a job as an assistant coach of the University of Tennessee’s team.</p><p>In 1989 Jon started working at the University of the Pacific and this added a lot to his net worth. Step by step, Gruden gained more attention and in 1992 he got an opportunity to work with the “Green Bay Packers”, but soon he was noticed by the “Philadelphia Eagles”, for whom he worked between 1995-98. In 1998 Jon changed teams again and started working for the “Oakland Raiders”. This had a huge impact on the growth of Jon’s net worth. Jon worked with this team until 2002 when he became the head coach of another team, called “Tampa Bay Buccaneers”.</p><p>“The Bucks” was the last football team coached by Jon and with whom he was able to win the “Super Bowl XXXVII”. This undoubtedly made Jon Gruden’s net worth a lot higher, as he was the youngest coach of all time to win the title. Of course, there were ups and downs in his career, but it only made him more determined about his work. In 2009 Gruden was fired from his position as the head coach of the “Tampa Bay Buccaneers”, finishing his coaching career with a 54% regular season winning percentage, and 56% post-season.</p><p>In the same year Jon started working for the ESPN and its show, “Monday Night Football”. He even had his own show, called “Jon Gruden’s QB Camp”, which made him even more acclaimed in the television industry. Jon has been working with the ESPN up until now and despite the fact that he does not coach anymore, Jon still remains one of the most respected of coaches, and commentator/analyst.</p><p>All in all, Jon Gruden was able to achieve highest awards when he was considerably young. Undoubtedly, he has made a huge impact on football teams that he has worked with and his work and experience will always be respected and acknowledged.</p><p>In his personal life, Jon Gruden has been married to Cindy since 1991, and they have three children.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jon Gruden</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$22.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$6.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 17, 1963</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Sandusky, Ohio, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 10 in (1.78 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>American football player, Coach, American Football coach, Commentator</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>University of Dayton, Muskingum University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Cindy Gruden (m. 1991)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Deuce Gruden, Jayson Gruden, Jon Gruden II, Michael Gruden</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Jim Gruden, Kathy Gruden</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Jay Gruden</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Jon David Gruden</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://imdb.com/name/nm1707986</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Best Coach/Manager ESPY Award</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Sports Emmy Award for Outstanding Sports Personality – Sports Event Analyst</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Monday Night Football</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks><tr><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Odd facial expressions</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Older brother of Jay Gruden.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Will replace Tony Kornheiser on ESPN’s Monday Night Football broadcast team.
