Her mother lived close to the Fringe set and was traveling with her husband at the time of Jean’s birth. Her father was in Canada for the filming of his show Fringe in January 2012.</p><p>Her father stated the following to US Weekly when discussing Beatrice’s birth:</p><p>We used to go out and party in previous seasons, but during the most recent one, I’ll admit, I had a little less of that type of “fun” because my wife was close to starting the set and we had a baby up there in Vancouver.</p><p>He went on to say,</p><p>It was stressful since I knew she might give birth at any moment and didn’t know if everything would go according to plan because we were in a foreign country. “We weren’t sure whether the hospital was even going to take us!”</p><p>Beatrice was born into a family that was full of light, despite her parents’ perception that the circumstances surrounding her birth were somewhat difficult. She was born weighing 8 lbs. 60 z. Beatrice Jean turns 10 years old in 2022.</p><h3>Maternal Side Of Beatrice Jean’s Family Are All In The Movie Industry</h3><p>She is Ron Howard, a well-known American actor, producer, screenwriter, and director’s granddaughter. Ron received numerous honors, including the National Medal of Arts and the Academy Award, in recognition of his outstanding contributions to American cinema. Additionally, he received two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.</p><p>In addition, Beatrice’s grandma is a writer and actor. Additionally, her great-grandfather Rance Howard was a director, writer, and actor, and her great-grandmother Jean Speegle was an actress.</p><p>Additionally, her maternal aunts Jocelyn Howard and Paige Howard both have successful performing careers. However, Reed Cross Howard, her maternal uncle, who is a professional golfer, has a <a href=#>different career</a> objective.</p><h3>Her Ethnicity And Education</h3><p>A famous person’s mixed-race child was born in Canada. Her mother and father share the same lineage, which includes German, English, Scottish, Irish, distant French, and Dutch.</p><p>Regarding her education, she unquestionably attends school. According to her mother’s September 5, 2018, post, “First Grade! but also PHEW!,” she began her primary level studies that year. On the basis of this, she will start middle school in 2022.</p><h3>Beatrice Has A Older Brother</h3><p>Beatrice Jean Howard-Gabel is not the only child of her parents, in case you weren’t aware. Theodore Norman Howard-Gabel, her older sibling, was created on February 16, 2007. Her lone brother is now 15 years old and enjoys watching movies in the year 2022.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Beatrice-Jean-Howard-Gabel-Sibling-1.jpg alt="theodore norman howard-gabel,bryce dallas howard,seth gabel,beatrice jean howard-gabel,bryce dallas howard beatrice jean howard-gabel" width=315 height=279 sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Beatrice Jean Howard-Gabel’s Mom Battled Post-Partum Depression</h3><p>Bryce Dallas, Beatrice’s mother, had sadness with the birth of Theo, Beatrice’s brother. She learned she was pregnant just seven days after being married, and following the birth of her first kid, it became increasingly harder for her to care for the unborn child. She claimed that another difficulty she faced was breastfeeding.</p><p>“I thought my breastfeeding efforts were failing. My home was in disarray. I thought I was a lousy dog owner. I feared a movie I was set to star in just a few weeks after giving birth since I could hardly concentrate to read the script. I was certain I was a terrible actress.</p><p>She said that she had struggled with depression.</p><p>And worst of all, I had the distinct impression that I was a terrible mother—not just a bad one. Because I actually wanted to vanish whenever I looked at my son.</p><p>She struggled for more than one and a half years before one of her friends convinced her to seek professional care, to which she eventually listened.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Beatrice-Jean-Howard-Gabel-Bryce-Dallas-Howard-1.jpg alt="theodore norman howard-gabel,bryce dallas howard,seth gabel,beatrice jean howard-gabel,bryce dallas howard beatrice jean howard-gabel" width=315 height=280 sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She subsequently had homeopathic treatments and therapy, which assisted her in balancing her emotions and helped her return to her true self—a devoted mother, wife, and skilled actress.</p><h3>She Is Growing Up In Famous Family: Does It Affect Her?</h3><p>In today’s technologically advanced world, it is now hard for an artist to maintain his or her private life in private, especially with the growing paparazzi culture that even affects their family members. Beatrice Gabel, the daughter of famous parents, has experienced similar circumstances in her life.</p><p>Bryce, Howard’s mother, spoke with People about this and stated,</p><p>She remarked at the time, “It’s interesting because I got to experience such a comparable upbringing to the one my kids are experiencing. No’my parent is famous chat’ took place. You don’t notice those changes when you see someone every day.</p><p>She clarified further,</p><p>“Because I was raised in a setting where making movies and other things wasn’t a major part of my daily thought. It seems to be the same with my children as well,”</p><p>Therefore, based on this assertion, we may conclude that Beatrice is capable of handling all the commotion around the famous family.</p><h3>Beatrice Jean Howard Gabel Has Interest In Movies: Will She Started As An Actress?</h3><p>Jean loves her mother’s franchise television series, “Jurrasic World.” She even owns a miniature toy Indominous Rex. She might have been drawn to it because her family includes actors, which is why she might have shown more interest in her mother’s filmmaking endeavors.</p><p>If things continue in this manner, Beatrice has a good chance of following in her mother’s footsteps and pursuing a career in the film industry. Her mother had adopted a similar behavior as her father.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Beatrice-Jean-Howard-Gabel-Seth-Gabel-1.jpg alt="theodore norman howard-gabel,bryce dallas howard,seth gabel,beatrice jean howard-gabel,bryce dallas howard beatrice jean howard-gabel" width=315 height=316 sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She is only a school student at the moment, but who knows, she might soon appear in a project.</p><h3>Does Beatrice Appeared On Social Media Handle?</h3><p>She is a 10-year-old girl who has never used social media before. However, despite not having a personal account of her own, she occasionally appears in her mother’s social media posts.</p><p>Her mother uploaded her on her Instagram account, @brycedhoward, just a few months prior, in January 2022, with the caption,</p><p>One of the greatest blessings of my life has been witnessing Beatrice grow into a person of extraordinary generosity, dazzling wit, and real love for others and the world around her. Enjoy your birthday, Beatrice! Greetings from double digits! 1️⃣0️⃣</p><p>Beatrice is a shy person, but this caption of her mother demonstrates how stunning she is on the inside and out. Her parents are overjoyed to have her.</p><h3>Beatrice Jean Howard Gabel’s Net Worth</h3><p>Her net worth has not yet been calculated because she has not yet begun her career.
