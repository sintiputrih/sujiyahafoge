But that doesn't seem to be the case for <a href=#>Dr. Phil's sons Jay and Jordan McGraw</a>, who even followed in his footsteps. Here's everything you should know about them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Dr. Phil Wants His Fans To Stop Calling Him This</a></span></p><h2 id=what-does-dr-phil-39-s-son-jay-mcgraw-do>What Does Dr. Phil's Son Jay McGraw Do?</h2><p>Jay, the eldest son of Dr. Phil and his wife Robin McGraw, is an Emmy Award-winning creator and executive producer for Dr. Phil. He's worked on other series like The Test, MyNetworkTV's Decision House, and some CBS primetime specials featuring his father. Prior to that, he graduated from the University of Texas with a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology and earned his JD from Southern Methodist University. Nowadays, he's focused on his work as CEO of the Los Angeles-based Stage 29 Productions, Bird Street Books, Inc., and Ghost Mountain Books, Inc.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of that, he's also hosted the primetime FOX show Renovate My Family and is co-founder and Chairman of the Board of Doctor on Demand — an app that provides cheap teleconsultation services from healthcare providers all over the U.S. He's also a #1 New York Times bestselling author who's written six books including The Ultimate Weight Solution for Teens: The 7 Keys to Weight Freedom and Closing The Gap: A Strategy for Bringing Parents and Teens Together.</p><p>He's quite the multi-hyphenate. He's also a pretty lucky guy who ended up marrying Playboy model Erica Dahm in 2006. They now have two children together — Avery Elizabeth, 12, and London Philip, 10. We're sure Jay has also learned a lot from his dad's parenting skills. "[I showed] him [the importance of] investing time in your kids," Dr. Phil said of raising his eldest son. "I coached basketball for 14 years with my boys, and Robin and I never missed a game!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Moment Fans Started Noticing Bhad Bhabie's Changing Face</a></span></p><h2 id=what-does-dr-phil-39-s-son-jordan-mcgraw-do>What Does Dr. Phil's Son Jordan McGraw Do?</h2><p>Jordan didn't exactly follow in his father's footsteps, but he also got into the TV biz and ended up pursuing music. He's quite a successful musician. After releasing his first single Flexible in 2019, he's published a few more songs and even toured with famous bands like the Jonas Brothers. In 2020, he married another TV personality, Morgan Stewart. She's previously starred in Rich Kids of Beverly Hills and is a co-host in E!'s Daily Pop and Nightly Pop. Three months later, the two welcomed their first child Row Renggli McGraw.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dr. Phil couldn't contain his happiness at the time. "Row's welcoming committee/personal security!" he wrote on Instagram. "By the way … I am, OF COURSE, her favorite." In September 2021, the couple announced that they're expecting baby number two. "Round 2," Jordan wrote alongside a photo of his wife's baby bump. His mom Robin left a congratulatory message on behalf of her and Dr. Phil. "Yay!!! You and Morgan and Row are adorable!" she said. "We can't wait to meet baby No. 2! We love you."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What It's Like To Work With Dr. Phil</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-is-dr-phil-as-a-parent-to-his-sons>How Is Dr. Phil As A Parent To His Sons?</h2><p>Speaking to Today, Jordan revealed that Dr. Phil leaves his TV persona outside their home. "He's not Dr. Phil to me, he's my dad," said the HER hitmaker. But when they really need him to be a guru, the TV host "likes to sit there and watch [him] figure stuff out on [his] own with a smile on his big bald head." As a result, Jordan knows "where to go" if he has "a question." He also shared that he and Jay have learned how to avoid their dad's psychoanalytic tactics. "His tricks don't work on me," said the singer.</p><p>Dr. Phil also makes sure that his family remains top priority no matter how busy he gets. "I don't care how much you love your kid. You gotta take a break and recharge your batteries," he said of raising his sons. "It's important for the child too, because they learn, 'Hey, Mom and Dad went away, but they came back!' That's how you get away from separation anxiety." Jay added that his dad was never tough on them like people think. "People say he's very tough," he explained. "But if you really pay attention, he's equally as supportive, and he's always got a good answer that makes sense." According to him, "if it weren't" for Dr. Phil, he knows "for a fact" he "wouldn't be" the man he is now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>19 Surprising Facts About Dr. Phil's $30 Million Mansion</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2BmecOrZKmgmaHAbr%2FOp6pmopGuequ70Z2Yp2WdmLSzrdZmmKecXay1osCMnaZmrJiaxm6wzmg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./are-holly-and-nathan-from-too-hot-to-handle-still-together.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Are Holly and Nathan From Too Hot to Handle Still Together or Not?
