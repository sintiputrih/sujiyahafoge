Well, his name Kumail is an Islamic name for males implying ‘perfect’. He has proven perfection in most of his roles both on stage and in movies. Kumail was born on&nbsp;February 21, 1978, in Karachi Pakistan to Shabana (mother) and Aijaz Nanjiani (father).

The comedian was raised as a Muslim, however, he has taken a U-turn with his religion and is now regarded as an atheist.</p><p>The podcast host was a student at Karachi Grammar School and had his college education at Grinnell&nbsp;College in Iowa graduating in 2001 with a double major in computer science and philosophy.</p><p>Unlike so many actors in the entertainment industry who were keen about acting when they were younger, Kumail wasn’t one of such. He is a late bloomer who ventured into acting in 2011 after he co-hosted a video game-themed podcast; The Indoor Kids alongside Ali Baker. Just within a month, he started the show, his co-host left and Nanjiani later continued the show with his wife.

Sometime that same year, the host made an appearance&nbsp;on&nbsp;Ken Reid’s&nbsp;TV Guidance Counselor Podcast.</p><p>He kept on with his many shows and minor roles in several television sitcoms excelling in most of them. It was in 2017, after appearing in the romantic comedy film, The Big Sick that Shereen Nanjiani finally caught media attention. The film was written based on his relationship with his wife and was considered as one of the most acclaimed films produced that year. Also, it qualified for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and was ranked as the third highest grossing independent movie; grossing over 40 million within the year it was premiered. In 2019, Kumail would be featured in the movies; Men In Black International and Stuber.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span><strong>Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>From our gatherings, Kumail Ninjin has been booked for a few movies which are supposed to be released in the nearest future.
