The actor first opened up about his sexuality via a tweet in 2014. He said, “I can’t help but think about what a gift it is to be surrounded by this queer family of beautiful, hilarious, hardworking, and kind artists.”</p><p>The tweet appeared after the actor was done filming Fire Island. A predominantly gay ensemble leads this year’s LGBTQ+ rendition of Pride and Prejudice, Fire Island. The cunning George Wickham, played by Rupert Friend in the 2005 Keira Knightley version, is the inspiration for Zane’s character Dex.</p><p>In 2023, Zane is starring in Glamorous, a new dramedy on Netflix where he plays Chad Addison, the son of Catrall’s model-turned-makeup mogul Madolyn Addison and the Director of Sales for his mom’s makeup company.</p><p>While the actor appears single now, he was previously dating Zach Houghton Glassman. In 2017, they posted pictures of one another all over their Instagram profiles and left each other sappy remarks and comments. In fact, Zane called Zach his sweetheart.

After setting out on a trip to Guatemala with his parents and visiting the places they were previously photographed at. He added, “I asked my mother to bring them along on our trip and, somewhat naively, I hoped to meticulously track down the location of each one.”</p><p>However, his parents quickly discovered that “the task was much more complicated than I had originally anticipated.”</p><p>He shared a photo of his dad taken by his mother in front of his house in Panajachel. During that trip, his mom explored Guatemala for about a month before returning to her native Canada.</p><p>Zach added, “After she left, she and my father exchanged letters back and forth until they could meet again.”</p><p>While we know very little about his dad, Zach’s mother is named Barbara. In January 2014, Zach posted a pic of his mom, in the caption he wrote, “This was well before children, well before marriage, and during some of my first moments in Guatemala. I felt the country’s charm and fell in love with it right away.”</p><p>Zach described his mother to be a social butterfly who would frequently organize picnics with her friends around Panajachel.</p><p>“There was a small, connected expatriate population. We kind of stuck together and looked out for one another,” she said. “One of my favorite parts was having visitors and watching them be enchanted by Guatemala, too.”</p><p>The photo he shared, was “taken just before a picnic with my father and their friends Donna, Rod, and Donna who were visiting from Canada and Australia.”</p><p>His maternal grandfather Jim would introduce his father as “sin-in-law” since his parents were not married till 1979.

As Jean’s health declined, Zach’s father purchased the house and it became their family’s home.</p><h3><strong>Zach Houghton Glassman Job</strong></h3><p>Zach Houghton Glassman is the founder and CEO of Passion Passport.
