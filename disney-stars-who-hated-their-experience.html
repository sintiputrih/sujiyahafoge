Whether its company interference, interpersonal drama, or creative differences, many ex-stars seem to hold a negative opinion of their time in the Disney sphere.</p><p>These are twenty Disney stars who hated their experience.</p><h2 id=demi-lovato><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Demi Lovato</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Demi-Lovato.jpeg><p>Demi Lovato has certainly not been shy in voicing her disapproval of Disney. She gave a particularly scathing interview to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>, where she joked about getting PTSD from her time working with the company. She mainly&nbsp;took issue with the incredibly fast-paced working schedule, saying that they were all tired and overworked. She has also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a> that Disney asked her to fix the gap in her teeth to make her more attractive and profitable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Selena Gomez</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Selena-Gomez.jpeg><p>Selena Gomez now has a very successful career, and it can mainly be attributed to her time working with Disney, as no one will deny that Disney helped launch her into the mainstream. However, holds a somewhat negative opinion of Disney, saying that they forced her to be someone she wasn't. In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with the New York Times, she said she was "held to expectations" and that she was "forced to get very uncomfortable... in order to make the decisions I made."</p><h2 id=shia-labeouf><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Shia LaBeouf</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Shia-LaBeouf.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shia LaBeouf loves to experiment, and as such, he most definitely did not belong at Disney. According to an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with MTV, Disney was very controlling regarding the trajectory of his career. He states, "I never came out with a music thing, even though [Disney will] push you that way." He also stated that he "didn't just want to be a churn-'em-out guy" and that he never felt as if he belonged at Disney.</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Miley Cyrus</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Miley-Cyrus.jpeg><p>This may not come as a surprise, but Disney REALLY cares about making money. And this fact had greatly upset Miley Cyrus in the past. Miley told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a> that she "didn't own [her] own name" and that her mom "started understanding how many people take advantage of a child." She also states that she was grossly underpaid for her work on Hannah Montana, simply because she "didn't know any better."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hilary-duff><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Hilary Duff</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Hilary-Duff.jpeg><p>Hilary Duff was a mega successful child star, but like most child stars, the fame was starting to get to her head. Hilary gave an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> to Pride Source where she stated that the pressures of being famous and working around the clock were starting to negatively affect her mental health and that she needed to "bow out" for the sake of her own sanity. Luckily, the break worked out for her, and she now considers herself "very healthy."</p><h2 id=zac-efron><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Zac Efron</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Zac-Efron.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ah, they grow up so fast. Despite being the breakout star of High School Musical, Zac Efron has since turned his back on the whole Disney machine. It mostly started on Saturday Night Live, when Efron&nbsp;starred in a skit that made fun of hokey Disney movies and portrayed Walt Disney as an anti-Semite. Needless to say, some people were not happy, but Efron certainly walked away a new man.</p><h2 id=bella-thorne><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Bella Thorne</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Bella-Thorne.jpeg><p>Much like Selena Gomez, Bella Thorne was another victim of Disney's artificiality. She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nylon</a>, "When I got off [the Disney Channel], I stopped listening to people telling me that I needed to be this and that." She also states that Disney dictated her personality, saying, "I literally would talk with a higher voice in interviews because that was the whole innocent Disney appeal."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=raven-symon><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Raven-Symoné</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Raven-Symone.jpeg><p>Raven-Symoné came out as gay in 2016, but according to her, it was a major process that could have cost her her career. She apparently hid her sexual orientation from the world, because "it only mattered what could be sold as part of the Raven-Symoné brand." <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According</a> to her, "[I] had 15 people dictating what I should and should not look like. If I did whatever I want, it's not gonna sell. It doesn't go with the brand."</p><h2 id=joe-jonas><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Joe Jonas</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Joe-Jonas.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And wouldn't you know it, Joe Jonas was also controlled to a painful degree. Joe wrote an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">introspective piece</a> for Vulture which highlights his time at Disney. According to him, "There were so many things...[they] had to sugarcoat," primarily their lyrics. Joe states that this control stifled his creativity, and he began to feel like nothing but a Disney puppet (which, of course, he was). He eventually "hit a limit and thought, 'Screw all this,'" and we don't blame him.</p><h2 id=vanessa-hudgens><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Vanessa Hudgens</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Vanessa-Hudgens.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Disney stars face a serious risk of being typecast, and that is exactly what happened to Vanessa Hudgens. Vanessa has credited High School Musical with launching her career, but she's also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a> that it "closed people's minds up as to which characters I could portray." According to her, it took a lot of time and some serious effort to break the typecast and shed the "Disney star" stigma. Luckily, she did just that.</p><h2 id=tim-allen><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Tim Allen</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Tim-Allen.jpeg><p>We don't know if Tim Allen can be considered a "Disney star," but Home Improvement was on ABC, and ABC is owned by Disney, and the show was produced at Walt Disney Studios, so we're counting it! Tim Allen was left feeling betrayed after Jonathon Taylor Thomas left the show to pursue other interests, and their rift was allegedly so bad that Thomas refused to return for the final episode. Interpersonal drama sucks!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jo-marie-payton><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jo Marie Payton</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Family-Matters.jpeg><p>Family Matters was a whole different show before Urkel showed up. However, Urkel proved to be a huge fan favorite, and the show quickly devolved into wacky hijinks and childish humor. This did not sit well with Jo Marie Payton, who eventually left the show. She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explains</a> that it was for a myriad reasons, but one of them was that "[she] wasn't happy on the show."</p><h2 id=rowan-blanchard><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Rowan Blanchard</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rowan-Blanchard.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rowan Blanchard seemed to enjoy her time on Girl Meets World, except for one major thing - her co-star, Uriah Shelton. Shelton became an infamous figure for liking various anti-feminist posts on Instagram, which naturally irked Rowan Blanchard. She later <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">responded</a>, "[I] don't have time for him and his stupidity." Uriah vouched for Rowan's dislike of him, saying, "She really doesn't like me."</p><h2 id=ross-lynch-amp-laura-marano><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Ross Lynch & Laura Marano</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lynch-and-Marano.jpeg><p>Ross Lynch and Laura Marano are stars of Austin & Ally, and they&nbsp;don't seem to get along. The two have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted</a> that they often bicker and fight like an old married couple, and that their disagreements have grown so heated that they've made co-stars uncomfortable and afraid. Of course, they also state that it's just "friendly fighting," but that sounds like fake corporate talk to us. If it's bad enough to make your co-stars uncomfortable, chances are it's pretty bad...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashley-tisdale-amp-lucas-grabeel><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Ashley Tisdale & Lucas Grabeel</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Tisdale-and-Grabeel.jpeg><p>Chalk this couple up as more people who didn't enjoy making High School Musical.

Austin shared a lot of screen time with his fictional sister, Selena Gomez, on Wizards of Waverly Place. However, he soon grew disillusioned with Gomez's runaway success, and he was left bitterly upset once she decided to leave the show for more creative opportunities. He wrote a particularly shady message on Twitter, saying, "When an artists' definition of 'growing up with their fans' is creating content they aren't even allowed to see..." However, the two have since made up, and Austin sent her a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lovely message</a> on Instagram following her kidney procedure.</p><h2 id=emily-osment><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Emily Osment</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Emily-Osment.jpeg><p>It seems as if Emily Osment did not have a good time while filming Hannah Montana with Miley Cyrus. In fact, it doesn't seem like ANYONE had a particularly good time while filming Hannah Montana! Miley states in her book Miles to Go that, "There were times when I didn't think we could ever be friends.

Once upon a time, she was but a mere star of Disney's Shake It Up. Her co-star, Bella Thorne, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> J-14, "We were kind of forced to compete against each other. [It] made the whole first season of the show just very awkward for us." The two managed to work it out, and have since become good friends.</p><h2 id=lindsay-lohan><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Lindsay Lohan</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lindsay-Lohan.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lindsay Lohan only appeared on Ugly Betty for a handful of episodes, but from what it sounds like, those episodes were pure torture to produce. She was eventually&nbsp;let go from the show due to her malicious attitude, which allegedly includes cutting pictures of herself from the tabloids and refusing to go on set. The story also states that America Ferrera was "mean" to her, whatever that means.</p><h2 id=ariana-grande-amp-victoria-justice><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Ariana Grande & Victoria Justice</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Justice-and-Grande.jpeg><p>It's no secret that Ariana Grande and Victoria Justice do not get along, and the beef goes all the way back to the time together on Victorious. Most of the beef seems to stem from Ariana was cast on Sam & Cat, a move that reportedly upset their chemistry and caused a major rift in their relationship.
