The actor is taller than a lot of his co-actors in the industry. He is in the category of American actors who are taller than the average male American.</p><p>According to the statistical data published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in 2018, the average height for male Americans is 5 feet, 9 inches (1.75 m). This confirms the fact Austin Butler is above average height, as he is 3 inches taller than the average American male.</p><h2><strong>Austin Butler’s Height Earned Him The Role Of Elvis Presley In The Film, Elvis</strong></h2><p>Austin Butler played the role of Elvis Aaron Presley, the late American singer and actor in the biographical film titled Elvis. The late singer rose to the limelight to become one of the most influential musicians of his time. His prowess in rock and roll earned him the nickname “King of Rock and Roll.”</p><p>There were so many factors that made Austin the best fit for the role of Elvis in the film, which included his height. He auditioned along with other young actors, some of whom were the same height as the late singer and some who were a few inches taller than him. However, he still inked the role while others were disqualified for various reasons.</p><p>Here is a comparison of his height with that of the late Elvis Presley and other actors that were auditioned for the role of Elvis.</p><h3><strong>Austin Butlers Height Compared To Elvis Presley</strong></h3><p>Austin Butler became the best fit for the character of Elvis for his height. The late Elvis Presley’s height is measured at 5 feet 10 inches, while Austin stands at 6 feet. Following this, Austin Butler is taller than Elvis Persley by 2 inches.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Austin-Butler-and-Elvis-Parsley.webp alt width=696 height=391 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Given that he is a few inches taller than the late singer, the height difference was not very significant. In the movie, Austin Butler’s height was edited during the filming process to give a height that is likely the same with Elvis Presley’s.</p><p>To date, Austin Butler has not publicly opened up on how much he was compensated for the role of Elvis. Meanwhile, according to the report published by Showbiz Galore, it was stated that Austin was paid £581,343, which is about $700,000.</p><h3><strong>Miles Teller Is An Inch Above Austin Butler’s Height</strong></h3><p>Miller Teller is one of the actors who auditioned for the role of Elvis in the biographical film, Elvis. Teller stands at 6 feet 1 inch and is an inch taller than Austin.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Miles-Teller-and-Austin-Butler.jpg alt="Austin Butler Height" width=696 height=364 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>If Miles had been the same height as the late Elvis Parsley, maybe he would have made it to be the best fit for the role. However, a 3-inch height difference was a limiting factor as there are other actors with a closer height.</p><h3><strong>Is Austin Butler Taller Than Aaron Taylor-Johnson&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Aaron Taylor-Johnson also auditioned for the role of the King of Rock and Roll in the film Elvis. However, he&nbsp;got out of the audition even before it got to the final stage.</p><p><span>The Nowhere Boy star’s height would have been a perfect fit for the role, given that he stands at 5 feet, 10½ inches. He is ½ inch taller than the real character, the late Elvis Parsley who stood at 5 feet 10 inches. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p>Comparing his height with that of Austin Butler, Aaron Taylor-Johnson is 1½ inches shorter. His reasons for not making it in the audition may be based on other facts, but not his height.</p><h3><strong>Austin Butler’s Height Compared To Harry Styles</strong></h3><p>Harry Styles, an English actor, singer, and songwriter, stands at 5 feet 10 inches. The actor is 2 inches shorter than Austin Butler, who stands at 6 feet.</p><p>With Harry Styles’ height, it was concluded that he would definitely earn the role of the King of Rock and Roll even before the audition started. This is because his height is the same as that of the original character. However, the director chose Austin Butler, who is 2 inches taller, for other reasons.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Harry-Styles-and-Austin-Butler.jpg alt="Austin Butler Height" width=696 height=365 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><h2><strong>Austin Butler’s Weight and Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>Austin Butler has a body weight that is measured at 68 kg, which is 150 pounds.
