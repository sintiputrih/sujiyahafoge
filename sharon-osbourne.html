This was my year, my last hurrah, my chance to complete the circle and put a few old ghosts to rest. I had something to prove. I wanted it to be the perfect finale- ten years of something I had been a part of starting.”&nbsp;<strong>– SharonOsbourne&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“We can go for weeks without talking to each other, but we never have to explain why we haven’t been in touch. We simply pick up where we left off. That’s true friendship.”&nbsp;<strong>– SharonOsbourne&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“Talent is a gift from God. That is something that you are born with. To be able to be born with singing talent is just a gift. You can learn how to sing better, but you cannot learn to sing with a certain quality. It is just something you are born with.”&nbsp;<strong>– SharonOsbourne&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“I didn’t even think of my breasts in a nostalgic way, I just wanted to be able to live my life without that fear all the time. It’s not ‘pity me’, it’s a decision I made that’s got rid of this weight that I was carrying around.”&nbsp;<strong>– Sharon Osbourne&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“There is a hideous epidemic of it [marriage] being bound up with people’s careers. Everybody needs to stop looking for perfect, cardboard cut-out partners because that won’t work and it won’t last. If you have children and there is still love there, then you have to keep trying and absolutely exhaust that love before you opt-out. But if you don’t have children, then just head for the hills.”&nbsp;<strong>– SharonOsbourne&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2><h3><strong>How much is Sharon Osbourne worth?</strong></h3><p>Sharon Osbourne’s net worth is estimated to be $220 Million.</p><h3><strong>How old is Sharon Osbourne?</strong></h3><p>She was born on October 9, 1952, and is currently 70 years old.</p><h3><strong>How tall is Sharon Osbourne?</strong></h3><p>Her height is 1.57 m, which is equal to 5 ft 2 in.</p><h2><span id=summary class=ez-toc-section></span><strong>Summary</strong></h2><p>Sharon Osbourne has starred in multiple TV-shows that have helped her to gain incredible success.</p><p>Alongside her superstar singer husband Ozzy Osbourne, they starred in the reality show ‘The Osbournes’ which gained global success.
