That’s the premise of <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dexter</a></strong>, a series originally premiered on Showtime in 2006. The first eight seasons of Dexter were filled with mystery, intrigue, and a ton of murder. Dexter Morgan is a blood-splatter expert who works for the Miami Metro Police Department. Instead of just solving murders that happen in his local city, he also commits murders. Since he follows an ethical code and promises to only go after those who are guilty, he feels as though his lifestyle decisions are totally justified.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=578 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true>He is able to quietly quench his thirst for killing without taking the lives of anyone innocent. He’s mastered what it means to live a double life since the people closest to him don’t know a single thing about his dark secret. The cast of Dexter includes Michael C. Hall as the titular character, Jennifer Carpenter as Debra Morgan (Dexter’s sister), David Zayas as Angel Batista, and Desmond Harrington as Joey Quinn. The show also features Lauren Velez as Maria LaGuerta and Julie Benz as Rita Bennett. Here are some other shows to watch that are similar to Dexter.</p><h3 id=dexter-new-blood data-injectable=false>Dexter: New Blood</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9H1uSS_zkk</figure><p data-characters=561 data-current-count=861 data-injectable=true>Since Dexter: New Blood is a reboot series of the original Dexter, it undoubtedly has a place on this list. Dexter: New Blood premiered in 2021, picking up where the original series left off. The show is considered a crime drama filled with loads of mystery. To those who adored the original series, it’s definitely worth watching. Fans of the original show had to wait nearly a decade for this particular reboot to come out, but a lot of people believe it was worth the wait. In the reboot, Dexter is alive and well and hiding behind an alias… Jim Lindsay.</p><h3 id=you data-injectable=false>You</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=678 data-current-count=978 data-injectable=true>Dexter Morgan is constantly compared to Joe Goldberg from You on Netflix. Both men are pretty creepy, both men know how to stalk their prey, and both men are easily able to fly under the radar without anyone noticing them or the illegal activities they are engaging in. Dexter and Joe are both murderers, even though they have varying methods to their madness. Dexter kills other serial killers while Joe kills anyone who gets in the way of his romantic endeavors. This show is considered a psychological thriller and fans are currently waiting for the fourth season to be released. Penn Badgley, the star of the show, recently discussed his process for getting into character.</p><p data-characters=698 data-current-count=698 data-injectable=true>He told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vogue</a>, “Honestly, all I try to do is believe everything he says. In a way, it’s simpler but not necessarily easier than you’d think. He’s not a process-based serial killer. He doesn’t enjoy the process.” From Badgley’s perspective, Joe and Dexter are different in terms of how it feels to kill another person. Badgley continued saying, “[Joe] might enjoy controlling people, even when that means putting them in a box and torturing them, but actually, I think death and loss really trouble him and he’s not able to see that about himself.” There are certainly differences between Joe and Dexter, but their psychotic natures form a television kinship.</p><h3 id=station-eleven data-injectable=false>Station Eleven</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=595 data-current-count=895 data-injectable=true>After a devastating illness wipes out millions of people, the survivors who are left behind come together to rebuild a brand new world despite everything they’ve lost. Station Eleven premiered in 2021 and is available for streaming on HBO Max right now. It’s based on a novel by a Canadian writer named Emily St. John Mandel. When a fictitious swine flu pandemic devastates most of the population, it leaves those left behind in a very precarious situation. This show caused the attention of viewers around the globe because of what’s going on in the real world with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h3 id=the-following data-injectable=false>The Following</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=614 data-current-count=914 data-injectable=true>The Following premiered in 2013 and lasted for three seasons.

This particular serial killer mutilated and murdered 14 women before he was caught and put in prison. Agent Hardy makes it his own personal mission to put the killer back behind bars.</p><h3 id=yellowjackets data-injectable=false>Yellowjackets</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mX22D65TqAs</figure><p data-characters=643 data-current-count=943 data-injectable=true>Yellowjackets is a psychological drama that premiered in 2021.

It’s about a detective named Sarah Linden who considers herself to be dedicated to the Seattle police department. She gets assigned to mentor another detective named Stephen Holder who formerly worked with the narcotics division.</p><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>Since he’s more of a carefree individual, and she likes to follow all the rules, they occasionally clash. Their varying work ethics create a struggle to see eye to eye. In the midst of a major murder investigation, they realize they need to lean on each other to achieve justice regardless of their differences. In Dexter, the titular character works with the police department and butt heads with a handful of his co-workers… especially Doakes.</p><h3 id=the-sinner data-injectable=false>The Sinner</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true>The Sinner is a 2017 drama that focuses on a detective named Harry Ambrose. In each season of the show, he investigates a chilling homicide using unusual tactics that other detectives might not consider. Since it’s so easy for him to be an empathetic individual, his empathy comes in handy when solving his difficult cases.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>He also has a strong devotion to achieving justice based on his dark past and troublesome history.

The fact that there’s so much blood included in both True Blood and Dexter is one of the first factors that make these shows comparable. In True Blood, a pretty Louisiana waitress named Sookie Stackhouse comes from a small town and is typically viewed as nothing more than an oddball by everyone around her. She is a tad bit odd since she has the power and ability to read the minds of her friends and neighbors.</p><p data-characters=553 data-current-count=553 data-injectable=false>Worrying about her reputation amongst others is the last thing on her mind since she’s more interested in getting the attention of a vampire who is risen from the dead at the age of 173. In this show, vampires are able to live peacefully amongst humans since synthetic blood has been created. The fake blood makes it possible for them to survive without having to kill innocent people. It’s still difficult for vampires to fit in with society since a lot of human beings aren’t too keen on the idea of spending time next to a bloodthirsty vampire.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yovsitq7JlpJ2%2FqrjLoqWgZaOdvLi%2FjKWgpJ1dmbK5wMSrZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-whale-wars.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened to 'Whale Wars'?
