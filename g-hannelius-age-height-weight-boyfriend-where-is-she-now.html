Hannelius graduated from Sierra Canyon High School in 2017.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Where is she now?</span></strong></h2><p><span>G Hannelius began transitioning into more adult roles in 2016. That year, she appeared in the History Channel miniseries, where she played Missy Waller.&nbsp;However, her transition from Disney seems to be rather slow.&nbsp;Fans were excited when she booked the role of Christa Carlyle in the American television series Net Vollal Vandal, but she did not survive the first season of the series.</span></p><p><span>Although the actress remains active on social media, it looks like she’s taking an unofficial break from the industry.&nbsp;Fingers crossed, she gets back in the saddle as soon as possible!</span></p><h2><strong><span>Boyfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>G Hannelius is already building his romantic relationship story.&nbsp;His first relationship with Media Media was with a certain Jack Chaite.&nbsp;Unlike G, Jack is not in the entertainment industry.&nbsp;The duo started dating in late 2015 and Chiate immediately became popular among G fans when photos of their homecoming date surfaced online.</span></p><p><span>The couple would soon go Instagram official and start sharing cute snaps of themselves.&nbsp;G brought him to one of the red carpet events to support his hit show, Dog with a Blog.&nbsp;In 2017, when Jack graduated from Calabasas High School, Hannelius showed up as his prom date.</span></p><p><span>However, things seemed to take a turn for the worse after this photo from the prom, as it became the last photo they posted of each other.&nbsp;While Jack enrolled at USC as part of the Class of 2021, Hannelius continued his career.</span></p><p><span>In July 2018, Hannelius seemed to have found new love.&nbsp;She posted a photo of herself with a certain mystery boy later discovered to be Barrett.&nbsp;As time passed, Instagram posts of the two confirmed their romance.&nbsp;Barrett graduated from Chatsworth Secondary School in 2017.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Size weight</span></strong></h2><p><span>G Hannelius is short in stature, which makes his age a difficult question.&nbsp;The actress is 5ft 3in tall and weighs around 48kg.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGifXZ2ur7rEpaCuq12WtKZ5x56goKCkYsSmtcahq2aan66zs7XEp5tmr5iav6Z5yKxkrKCVYruww44%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./748318-what-is-conscious-rap.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is Conscious Rap?
