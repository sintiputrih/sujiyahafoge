While Gomez's parents couldn't make their relationship work, both her mom and dad went on to get remarried.Thanks to her parents' new relationships, Gomez became a sibling. Through her father, Selena has a stepbrother named Marcus and a half-sister named Victoria who seemingly goes by Tori. On her mother's side of the family, Gomez has another half-sister named Gracie Elliot Teefey.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is Selena Gomez's Dad, And What Does He Do?</a></span>In an ideal world, everyone would get along with the members of their family. In reality, however, some families are so toxic that people need to cut them off. Unfortunately, there are a surprising amount of <a href=#>celebrities who have intense sibling rivalries</a>.Even though they are half-sisters, Gomez and Teefey easily could have a rivalry or failing that, they could have nothing to do with each other. For that reason, some of Gomez's fans have been left wondering what her relationship with her little half-sister Gracie is like.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-selena-gomez-close-with-her-half-sister-gracie-elliot-teefey>Is Selena Gomez Close With Her Half-Sister Gracie Elliot Teefey?</h2><p>By the time Selena Gomez's little half-sister Gracie Elliot Teefey was born, the singer was already an adult in her early-20s. For that reason, Gomez and Teefey didn't get to go through the process of growing up together which bonds a lot of siblings.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>There's A Specific Reason Selena Gomez Absolutely Hates Giving Interviews</a></span></p><p>Fortunately for Gomez and Teefey, siblings don't have to grow up together to love one another and from all accounts, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the half-sisters are very close</a>. In fact, it seems very likely that the siblings would dislike the idea of being called half-sisters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/selena-gomez-and-gracie-elliot-teefey.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shortly after Gracie was born, Gomez spoke to E! News about her little sister and she made it clear she already adored Teefey. On top of that, Gomez revealed that the Teefey's birth made her see being a role model in an all-new light.</p><p>"I'm obsessed with her and becoming a big sisterâ€¦I know I've had the responsibility to be a role model for girls, but when you have a little sister of your own, you kinda think, 'OK, this is legit."</p><p>Much more recently in March 2022, Gomez posted two images of herself and Gracie wearing fancy dresses together on Instagram. While the photos were adorable, it was the caption that was truly heart-warming. "forever my favorite human"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it is great to express your love for someone with your words, it is actions that really communicate how much you care. With that in mind, it seems pretty clear that Gomez truly loves her little sister.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/selena-gomez-and-gracie-elliot-teefey-1.jpg><p>In 2019, Gomez got the chance to attend the premiere of the highly anticipated movie Frozen II. Instead of bringing a significant other to the event, Gomez was accompanied by her little sister Teefey. On top of that, Gomez and Teefey even attended the premiere in matching outfits.</p><p>On top of taking Teefey to watch Frozen II, Gomez has also gone to other events with Gracie as well. A perfect example of that is the time that Gomez and Teefey went to see an Olivia Rodrigo concert together. Given <a href=#>how massively popular Rodrigo's album "Sour" was</a>, it seems likely the sisters had a wonderful time at the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On Gomez's Instagram account, fans will also see photos of the famous singer just hanging out with Teefey. With all of that in mind, it seems very clear that the sisters simply love each other and really enjoy being together.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-selena-gomez-s-little-sister-scarlett-teefey>What Happened To Selena Gomez's Little Sister Scarlett Teefey?</h2><p>This is a trigger warning that the rest of this article will touch on the topic of miscarriage in general terms.</p><p>Before Selena Gomez's sister Gracie Teefey was born, the sisters' mother Mandy and her husband Brian were preparing to bring another baby into the world they named Scarlett Teefey. Tragically, however, Mandy suffered a miscarriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though society often ignores how painful going through a miscarriage is, Scarlett clearly hasn't been forgotten. In fact, on the sixth anniversary of Scarlett's passing, so many of Gomez's fans paid tribute to her lost sister that her mom Mandy Teefey was so touched <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she thanked them on Instagram</a>.</p><p>"Thank you to all the fans who honored our Scarlett yesterday. Dec 17th will never be the same, but we decide to celebrate her by writing her letters on red balloons and releasing them."</p><p>"She was there in spirit as always. A moms love for their children is pretty fierce. In order of my girls, Selena, Scarlett and Gracie."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGieq5mTnrJusculoKisXamyprLEsmSsnZyau6J5xqiknrJdqLa0wMSrZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./shiloh-jolie-pitt-siblings-relationship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Close Is Shiloh To The Rest Of The Jolie-Pitt Kids?">&larr;
